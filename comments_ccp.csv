They were poised to beat Europe for control of the seas. They they set it on fire. There was a political power shift, and since the new rules rivals built that Navy, it had to be a bad idea. Unfortunately, focusing on internal matters and isolationism didn’t help, it only made them divided and weak. This lead to and allowed for European involvement, which has been seen by many in China as a humiliation, and the source for all of the countries problems. It’s certainly one of the reasons why the anti imperialist narrative of communism took hold and continues to be a used to excuse failures by the Chinese. The Chinese communist party doesn’t want peace with us. It wants to control its population by uniting them against foreign enemies. It wants to China to be seen as harmless victims so that they 白左 will resist any resistance to China with their naive hopes of abstract ideals making for good foreign policy.

They have spies all over our country and they are stealing information in all fifty states. They are using this trade abuse and this intellectual property theft to build a military. What they’ve done with modernizing their military makes Hitlers little buildup look quaint, which I suppose it was. His generals told him he was going to war to early, that he should have kept building his forces while he was getting away with it. China won’t make the same mistake, they have studied us well, and they know our weaknesses. Even our advantages are being countered. They are trying to beat us to deep space, and if they get enough weapons up there before we do, we will be at perhaps the greatest strategic disadvantage in history. We live in a war where people want to kill you. Utopian nonsense at a time like this is going to get a lot of people killed. This reset is utopian nonsense.

Neither did Dr. Fauci in the beginning. Literally every news source in the first two months of the pandemic said it was bad to wear masks and that they'd do nothing. If you're blaming all of this on Trump, you're grossly misinformed.&gt;Now America's response to the virus has been an embarrassment to the world. That's honestly completely subjective. What about Sweden's response? They didn't initiate any of the lockdowns or mask mandates to the degree of the other countries and they're looking pretty good right about now.&gt;I have a 4 year old niece who misses her friends and daycare. She sits in zoom calls and has spells where she just sort of mopes and when we ask her what's wrong she shrugs and says she's sad that we don't go shopping or visit friends or do the things that we did before. And I feel for you, but then go to your local state reps and start demanding they initiate re-opening.

For Christ's sake the WHO recently predicted that the COVID death rate was only [0.13%](https://www.wnd.com/2020/10/4859570/). If you're so afraid of a virus with a 99.87% chance of survival and have let that put a grinding halt to your life, then that's 100% on you and not on Trump. You know what I've done since the lockdowns? I've hiked every day, I got married with 20 people there, I've still gone out to bars and restaurants, and I still see friends on a regular basis. &gt;Over 200K American DEAD. None of this is normal.You know that Dr. Fauci [said](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dr-deborah-birx-predicts-200-000-deaths-if-we-do-n1171876) that we'd only see 200k dead if we did things almost perfectly, right? So does that mean that Trump saved millions? Of course large amounts of death aren't *normal* but I didn't see anyone freaking out to this degree when the [flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden-averted/2017-2018.htm#table1) infected 45 million people, 810,000 hospitalizations, and 61,000 deaths in 2017.&gt;Compare that to how things were in 2016, and you don't think trump has royally fucked up the country?I'd like to pose the same question, please, tell me why you think that the world has become worse since 2016? Because frankly, everyone who hated Trump said we'd be in the middle of World War 3 within his first year of taking office.&gt;How? Why? Based on what?A lot, actually. The guy reinforced our border, called out China on its bullsh\*t and got the world more aware of what the CCP is doing globally, lowered taxes for the average American worker, pretty much destroyed ISIS, signed multiple peace deals in the middle east, made animal abuse federally illegal, signed executive orders to initiate police reform and lower prescription drug prices, initiated talks with North Korea, and negotiated a better trade deal with Canada and Mexico.&gt;Economy, We had a great economy and brought hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs back to the US, the ones that Obama said Trump would ""need a magic wand"" to bring back.&gt;unemploymentWe had record low unemployment.&gt;health, overall happiness,Not really sure what you want me to say here, America has been one of the fattest countries in the world and has never ranked particularly high in the happiness rating, but those are also deep rooted problems that I don't think any one president can fix.&gt;take your pickI did, and Trump did a **lot** for this country.

The 60's were a good bit before my time so I dont have first hand knowledge of how extreme the alarmists were back then,  but if the alarmists of today are any metric it was out of hand back then too.  The climate change narrative has gone from (what I assume, at one time was) ""lets make the planet better for our kids"" to ""lets have some swedish brat scream at the UN general council for 20 minutes and call it a day"".  Also some how the media has spun it that only the US, and only conservative voters are to blame for global warming; and we're supposedly the conspiracy theorists? This kind of spiraled into a number of different issues, but it boils down to one thing. Climate change has gone from something that should be bipartisan (conservatives pushing free-market solutions, liberals pushing government ones) and the left has adopted it as a billy club to demonize anyone who disagrees with them. &amp;#x200B;&gt; You've stated several times now that you fear impossible scenarios happening because of this system Impossible? Shifting brackets and tax rates are not a ballot issue. Its decided by congress and carried out by the IRS (a wholly unelected office). All it takes is a majority of nutjobs taking control of congress to push through taxed-to-homelessness brackets. Maybe this hypothetical progressive tax code will set some kind of bare-minimum floor, but the fact remains that if government (elected or otherwise) has control of the tax code, it will be prone to abuse. All it takes is a vote of Congress to yank that floor right out from under the American people. &amp;#x200B;&gt; With what money? Not his own that's for sure. China or any other US-hostile government would pounce at the chance to pick up Amazon and take it away from the US. You're right it'd be financial suicide for him alone to pay the penalties to move Amazon in its entirety to Beijing (for argument's sake, I'm sticking with China here) the the thing is the CCP has deep pockets and would not only pay whatever the cost for Amazon to domicile there but also give them seamless adaptation to the Chinese market. Not only would he make up for that lost American market, he'd arguably even double his customer base (470m vs 1.3bn by population alone).Honestly before everything went off the deep end, this would have been far fetched. Now? It seems very possible. Especially when the only thing the DNC seems to agree on is the faux-populist stance that somehow anyone can be a boogeyman white supremacist if they have enough zeros in their net worth.&amp;#x200B;&gt; I'm not sure what you're getting at here.  I explained in my 2nd paragraph there, why do these accountants care so much about social policies their employees will not use while employed by their company. I agree that their economic productivity is directly tied to corporate interest, but I fail to see the connection beyond that. If they're employed they wont have to take social program handouts. If they're not employed, what does the company care. &amp;#x200B;&gt; I think this skepticism is there actually, possibly misguided at times, Why? For the record I'm not just skeptical of government, I'm skeptical of corporations too, I'm skeptical of monolithic religious institutions, I'm skeptical of just about everything. However each power structure has the right to exist if only as a check and balance against the others. As I see it, no one power type should have absolute unilateral power, even if democratically elected. Right now the modern left platform is all about expanding government and crushing out corporations and religion which of course is concerning.&amp;#x200B;&gt;  But as far as maintaining some giant infantry just in case, well, that's rather obsolete in today's world. I disagree, after all Russia annexed Crimea only a couple years ago with just ground infantry and armor. Despite being two oceans away from our enemies, the US is still at risk of land invasion. &amp;#x200B;&gt; Neutral yes, isolationist, far from it.  Again I'll have to disagree. Switzerland has little to no interest in even dealing with the EU period, let alone politically and engaging other countries isnt even on the table. Isolationism is [limiting international involvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism) , so far Switzerland has followed that line better than almost any other country. One might even conclude the DPRK is no longer isolationist due to it's closer dealings with China and semi cold conflict with Trump / Japan. &amp;#x200B;&gt; Actually, using military force in any first world country to fix one of their elections would be a rather serious sign that either the US was electing a puppet, or that the country was already a failed state.  Isn't this exactly what we did with post-WW2 Germany? Granted we didnt fix elections per se but we did stage a massive offensive, culminating in the death of Hitler (the sitting Chancellor) and the rise of the ideologically-opposing CDU during such time we spent over 5 years occupying Germany removing the Nazi influence and generally trying to rectify the country. Germany is far from a failed state today.&amp;#x200B;&gt; quickest way to be kicked out of NATO, which might be what you want? Either way, the EU would be just fine, the US on the other hand would be left with very few allies. You're partly right, I think we would be better off departing from NATO and involvement in the UN (along with any other globalist agreement) but it should be a voluntary exit not a punitive one. I dont think the EU would be just fine, Russia would come knocking the minute our last base closes. Without the US to back them, the EU would fall to Putin quickly. Quicker if embittered euroskeptics turn against the Ministry. The EU would also be unable to hide behind the UK post-brexit. On the contrary, the US would be free of any involvement in that conflict and our servicemembers would be home with their families ready to defend when called upon.

An eye for an eye. &amp;#x200B;&gt; Why do you think one group should get the death penalty, but another fines or jail? Within the US, American citizens are protected by the 8th amendment from cruel and unusual punishment. As much as I dislike her, even Whitmer didnt knowingly intend to kill Americans with her mismanaged response. Holding govs or the FDA / CDC to the same criminal standard as the CCP is unjust and unduly cruel. The CCP is afforded no such protections, they'd have to answer to international courts for their genocide of innocent civilians across multiple countries. &amp;#x200B;&gt; I suppose a better question is, do you support the death penalty as a court ruling when American citizens are on trial? Only when the accused had knowing and prior intent to cause the crime that was committed; Premeditated murder, for example. In that context, it's just that the Court has knowing and prior intent to put the criminal to death. &amp;#x200B;&gt; Do you think anyone from the Trump admin (including Trump) should be held accountable for his handling of the pandemic response? I support Trump not his staff, if it's deemed that one of his cabinet was negligent or otherwise caused greater covid fatalities, they should be held accountable. I do not believe Trump himself shoulders blame for the death of Americans during the pandemic. Admittedly he'd have been better served laying off the tweets for a while, but him being skeptical of the virus doesnt make him a killer.  It's important to separate the man from the president, Trump as an individual was skeptical of the virus, Trump as a president was one of the first to propose banning travel to and from china ( [source](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-ban-travel-china-pandemic/) ). Also he made state's rights and a truly federalist response to the virus a key policy point. He let each governor respond as they saw fit, and let them be responsible.

The chinese people as a race are not to blame for Covid, the Chinese government and it's ruling party is. Of course, any death should be carried out as punishment prescribed by a court or (if we were to go to war) in armed conflict. Even though it may be a kneejerk reaction to go after their civilians the way they went after ours, we should hold the moral high ground despite suffering grave losses of innocent life. &amp;#x200B;&gt; should that figure include people from America who are responsible for mismanaging the pandemic response? Yes, though the punishments should be prison time / fines, not death. I'm 100% in favor of prosecuting the FDA and CDC et al for their individual roles in spreading the virus and inhibiting a cure or even a vaccine from being developed. Also, governors should be taken to task over their priorities during the lockdown.

To bring back jobs and factories and corporations to America?&gt;&gt;	Perhaps the US government could subsidize these corporations and factories, even the jobs, to make them competitive?That was certainly his goal and still is. There’s been meaningful progress there too. We had to stop the “sucking sound” as Ross Perot famously described the jobs leaving America due to NAFTA. It was truly disastrous policy. That’s globalism though. There’s a nativity to believe that the most powerful country in the world benefits from managed decline to the median... I.e. globalism. It’s amazing how a president like Trump is condemned for being a nationalist... isn’t the American president supposed to be America first? Who wants managed decline?? Obama wanted us to accept it. Remember when he said our best days were behind us and the jobs aren’t coming back- have to get used to the new norm? That’s accepting decline. Biden was the same way, selling us off to China- I honestly don’t know why. I know his son’s company got a 1.4 billion dollar investment from China- and i still believe that it couldn’t possibly as bad as it sounds. I just don’t know why our point man to China, Biden, allowed absolutely everything to leave to China. &gt;	And how is that bad? If China regulated to the same standards, then pollution would drop overall.China will never... and I mean until the CCP falls, they will never play by the rules. You really have to listen to hours of testimony and history of the CCP and Maoism. That regime beat the morality and the sole out of their people to implement their communism. Religion is illegal- you have state run churches with pictures of XJP, because he is their God mandated from heaven. They murder the people who open real underground churches. They get children to turn in their dissident parents for execution and raise them as heros. They give you a social score which you maintain as the only way to get an education, a job, and a livable means. You dissent and you and the generations after you are cockroaches.... and it’s easy to get caught when they control the social media and communication.....that’s terror. That’s why we need to value freedom and liberty above all else. Fuck the gun grabbers- that’s a farce used to make people give up their guns because speech and liberty will soon follow. You can’t appease them China- they consume. Hong Kong was their last bastion of income (besides North Korea which is a slave arm or the CCP) - look at Hong Kong fighting for their independence bc they WERE the last free, independent and wealthy region. The CCP needs their resources so is killing the dissidents and squashing the revolution like a bug. The disgusting Lebron James and other NBA fools admonished the Houston Rockets owner for speaking out for Hong Kong bc of their Nike contracts and CCP basketball market. The CCP simply does not allow dissidents and they infiltrate our corporations and media... all with money, to bully them into compliance. A corporation could say “fuck  president Trump “ before they could said “the CCP is a murderous regime”. Do you wonder why no one seems to care that they have millions of minority Muslim Uighurs concentration camps, doing live organ harvesting??? As you can see, I’m just not interested in playing ball with them. I could also go on about the history of their unsafe communist run coronavirus lab that resulted in a world wide pandemic, but that’s for another day.  We wouldn’t want to blame them for the virus, they might pull out their support of our media. &gt;	This is something I’ve seen a lot and it bugs the hell out of me, cause it is a half-truth. Yes, bunker fuel pollutes more than all cars on Earth combined and then some, but it isn’t CO2, It’s sulfur oxide. And boy is it plentiful in bunker fuel... Gas and diesel are basically free of it, thanks to environmental regulations (as sulfur dioxide has pretty bad effects on humans and life in general https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/pollution/monitoring/air/air-pollution/pollutants/sulfur-dioxide), but bunker fuel is allowed over 1% by volume of sulfur dioxide. 0.1% in certain harbors, mostly in first world countries. Meanwhile, gas has basically none of it. Neither does diesel.Thanks for this - I remembered there was an asterisk, I just couldn’t recall the details but I have read that. Having goods produced in poorly regulated (like China bad) environments and shipped with bunker fuel to the US just doesn’t make good environmental policy. Nit picking US policy is very small in comparison. That was the issue with the Paris Climate accord.

Sweden chose this course of action, because they knew the migrants could be kept on a short leash via their welfare system while the government carries out systematic extermination of Christian Swedes.

His gripe is the blatant dismissal by the media due to Trump hailing it as a miracle drug. He isn't a trump supporter, but as he grew up in Hong Kong and has faced issues with the CCP, he really dislikes media misinformation. I was able to look at studies with him regarding Hydroxychloriquine and Ivermectin. This allowed me to better understand the information. Hydroxychloroquine is very very safe, and very likely does not cause detrimental effects in Covid patients. However, Hydroxychloriquine is only effective at the absolute beginning of Covid infection. Very importantly, it should be administered by a doctor, self medicating as some people did is a very bad idea.Many well respected scientists/doctors, including my father-in-law tore apart early studies on the ineffectiveness of Hydroxychloriquine for Covid. I can agree with them on this point 100%. However they aren't hailing Hydroxychloriquine as a miracle cure. It may help, but in rare instances only, and isn't always helpful. In a lot of early studies that supported Hydroxychloriquine as a possible beneficial medication usually used it in conjunction with other medications like azithromycin (z-pak).So yeah CNN and many other networks reported poorly on Hydroxychloriquine, but this was also after people were self medicating with it and hurting themselves. In my opinion, CNN messing up isn't nearly as bad as blatantly lying about the effectiveness of masks. It's detrimental to our country and could easily increase infections. I guess my overall point is that tweets should be flagged if they can easily lead to harm in some manner like telling people masks don't work. This goes for both parties, but for Covid it has largely been conservative politicians going again scientific research. My figures may be off, but I'm pretty sure 7 out of the 8 politicians in Congress that caught Covid were republicans who refused to wear masks/made a mockery like wearing a gas mask. Then the states that are responding to Covid the best have easily been blue states. This shouldn't be because a public health issues shouldn't be politicized, but it has been. However Republicans have chose to politicize this public health issue. What is your personal take on masks and social distancing? How about on the limitations of certain business to help social distance?

Did you know that the democrats actually and provably were involved in foreign collusion in the last election and that collusion provably was with the Russian government? Its another case of the democrats claiming the other side is doing exactly what they are doing. I actually didn't. I don't really want to get into the Russian collusion topic, but could you share a link on this?&gt;So at the end of the day, Russia played both sides and therefore was completely successful in getting this country to destroy itself from the inside outI completely agree, though the country has a lot of deep rooted issues. Russia, or whoever else, just lit a match.&gt;But they arent money laundering schemes or illegal for trump. They are merely real estate transactions. Trump could probably care less after he gets to successfully over charge and have people buy his real estate. That isnt illegal. Its merely capitalistic. If Trump knew, or reasonably knew that it was laundering money then he could be complicit could he not? I won't pretend that I know the details of mob money laundering, but for an example a trump crony as of 2017 was involved in a huge fraud scandal in the past with Trump connections and 5 different mob groups. I think it was Felix Sater? He was convicted, but got out. I'm saying that maybe stuff like that could come to light, that's currently hidden because the various parties are still using it.&gt;This was done under Obama not Trump and to be fair, Obama caused it to happen by encouraging Ukraine into NATO. Obama ignored Putin threatening retaliation and finally Putin actually did retaliate and took back the water access it once owned. The Baltic states should remain neutral. We didnt like Russia putting nukes in Cuba and Russia doesnt like converting its neighbor into its enemy. My bad, I meant that Putin was still under sanction for it. And NATO is primarily a protective pact against Russia, so of course Russia isn't going to be happy if all the Soviet states are joining. Putin just knows that if Ukraine joined, which it was heading towards, it's would be completely unable to ever expand westward again. I'm all for the Baltic states joining, they were invaded and occupied for decades and don't want that to happen again.&gt;You cant say Trump is aiding putin and applying tariffs at the same time. Those are opposite things.Sure I can. There are a thousand other ways to aid people. Also, Russia wasn't singled out for tariffs, they just fell under the general steel and aluminum tariffs that pretty much everyone else got too. Plus, after China was tariffed they changed a lot of trade to Russia, so Russia actually had a net gain due to the whole trade war issue. Sanctions are something else however, and credit where it's due, he's really coming down on the CCP hard with them, which we should all be doing.&gt;Like? Attempt to interfere in US elections, annex Crimea, invade the donbass region, and try to assassinate a UK citizen.&gt;Why cant it be BOTH?It can be both, but so far I've only seen proof of Russia. And if I recall correctly, Trump was trying to say it was Ukraine instead of Russia, not both.&gt;Because its not credible information as stated by the Pentagon, CIA and another agency i currently forget.Ok, I'll drop this point until I've had a chance to catch up with it.&gt;I think im fairly knowledgeable on near everything brought up here and nothing seems suspicious from a Trump is suspicious perspective but i would certainly like to know the root of the russian bounty propaganda and things of that sort that are used as propaganda against trump.I mean, it's probably the same place any other propaganda comes from (if it is), but I think that after all I've said, it's still rather suspicious that Trump is so friendly with Putin after dealing with the Russian mob for decades. Here's another look at it, Trump knows that he has 8 years max and then he's gone and back to running the company. If he's getting a lot of loans and ""investments"" from Russia (which he is, he's said as much during the 2008 crash where he was largely unscathed because his money and loans were through Russian banks) then he could be completely above board but just favouring Putin in order to keep the business dealings open. It's well known that he has trouble getting loans from US and European banks because of his record, so if Russia closed it's doors to him it could be really, really bad for the future of the company.

These people in power in the media have agendas, and many are sympathetic to the CCP. The article you linked to said the following: ""There were approximately 781 000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30, 2020, representing 122 300 (95% prediction interval, 116 800-127 000) more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. There were 95 235 reported deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 from March 1 to May 30, 2020. The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than the official tally of COVID-19–reported deaths during that period. In several states, these deaths occurred before increases in the availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and were not counted in official COVID-19 death records.""This study didn't at all mention that many states including my own are counting any and all deaths that ""look"" like covid 19 as covid deaths, with or without tests. It didn't consider a variety of factors, such as the rapid uptick in suicides and overdoses since the lockdowns began. Meanwhile, reported flu cases suddenly dwindled into nothing in March, which leads me to believe there was a lot of flawed and inaccurate reporting. Yeah, plenty of people died. But this is not deadlier than the flu according to the CDC, and that's without a vaccine. We've had flu vaccines for decades. Mass stress on a national level plays a role in illness and mortality as well, In addition to delayed cancer and numerous other critical  treatments in the early stages of lockdowns. Somehow I don't believe this is all due to covid cases. I'm going to assume you meant pneumonia deaths. Those have been rapidly declining since April: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htmFor a time, yes, there was a surge given that this is a novel virus and there were a lot of deaths, especially if you'll notice in states where nursing home patients were put back in there to infect highly vulnerable populations. Almost 50% of deaths in numerous states were in nursing homes alone. This could have been preventable, at least to an extent, with different policy decisions. In addition, you'll see in states like Florida that while they are seeing temporary rises in cases and hospital capacity, the mortality rate has declined dramatically, from 4% in March to .4% today. This is because there's a lot we've learned about managing and treating the virus since. This same adaptation happens every flu season, with many hospitals even putting up overflow tents as they have recently to cope with the surge of cases. This is a regular occurrence each year, especially in highly populated areas, yet we don't shut everything down for if.",,,1595295644,{},fyq0km0,False,t3_hu11k7,False,True,t1_fypybez,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/hu11k7/how_do_you_feel_about_trump_attempting_to_block/fyq0km0/,1595382803,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1595295644.0,,

I don't blame all of the people for this specific event.&gt;Is China to blame for the spread of the virus?Absolutely. They allowed citizens of Wuhan to travel internationally while banning their travel domestically. They allowed this when they started locking down Wuhan because of the virus and its spread.I'm aware of the way many Communist governments tend to work in terms of who they appoint to positions of power and influence. These tend to be inner party members who are appointed out of loyalty instead of merit. The inevitable result is ALWAYS a high level of incompetence.So, I posit the following:1. The Chinese government was researching and experimenting with a SARS virus. Whether it was an eventual bio-weapon or ""innocent"" research is unknown. Given the nature of the virus and the tinkering that can be seen with it, as well as the nature of the CCP and its goals, I'm inclined to believe the former.2. However, the release of the virus was likely due to simple incompetence. A faulty door seal. A researcher who failed to disinfect properly. A misplaced or mixed up vial/petri dish that exited the secure areas of the lab. Simple incompetence.3. Whether the release was purposeful or not, the CCP attempted to cover up the release of the virus to save face. A Communist government must always appear as if it were God (omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient). To admit failure is to admit fallibility, which shatters the illusion that the government is God. When you shatter that illusion, the subjugated ~~serfs~~ citizens see that the emperor has no clothes and the power the government wields is proven to be nothing but air.It is because of #3 that I place the responsibility for this crisis on China's government. It's because of #3 that I believe the country itself should be sanctioned into economic oblivion.Why? Because had they admitted something was wrong, many lives could have been saved. Because had they admitted they made a mistake, much of the Western World, while they would hold them to account for the mistake, wouldn't have outright condemned them. Instead, the West would have likely HELPED them contain the virus and protect their people. This is because the Western World values truth over face. When you tell the truth to the Western World, it tends to be far more forgiving and helpful.I say the Western World because most other civilizations value face over truth, and they would not be forgiving or helpful. Perhaps that's who the CCP actually fears.

I always pose this question to people who bring this up: do you think that the impact of this virus would have been greater or lesser had it originated in a nation like Germany? Meaning, with more global cooperation and an immediate response from the international bodies as opposed to one that was delayed by a couple months due to misinformation, would the world have been more capable of identifying, containing, and preparing for the spread of COVID-19? To me, the answer is “almost certainly” because of the fact a country like Germany would, unquestionably, coordinate with the global community and would have relayed accurate data on the speed of spread, the mortality, and other critical points of information in regards to COVID.  &gt; That said, there's also a limitation on what we can actually influence. The CCP is always going to do CCP things, but we at least can take a hard look at our own internal processes and change them to better ourselves. That feels like a better use of our time than trying to tell the CCP to not cover things up. Do you disagree?So, for starters, there are actually quite a few things we can do to influence the CCP and Chinese interests. For starters, trade “punishments” in response to this will hit the country where it hurts the most - in their pockets. If you want to make a group of people listen to you despite their obvious insistence otherwise, then take away their main source of income. The Chinese economy is still *massively* based in foreign commerce - removing or damaging that will have huge ripple effects within their country that even the threat of doing so would force some degree of (hopefully positive) change. Beyond that, I agree that there’s no reason we can’t look at our internal response, but thats very difficult in light of what’s happened. Our pandemic response is largely based in global cooperation - I.e being generally aware of the fact that the disease exists, is spreading at a certain rate, and has a certain mortality associated with it. Unfortunately, China interrupted this flow of information when they covered up what was happening - the first cases were identified in November of last year, and the first case that arrived in the states was on Dec 31st while the CCP was reporting a handful of cases (reports now indicate that the known number was likely in the thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, by then).

Shouldn't basic safety priorities be that we put out the fire first, and then figure out why the fire happened?That’s actually a fair question. I’ll answer it in two parts. 1. Why do we care about China (right now)They’re the global #2 (#3 according to some) superpower, for starters. It’s pretty obvious at this point that they deliberately and willfully covered up the outbreak at home in an attempt to save face and stockpile medical supplies imported from foreign nations that would ultimately wind up with the disease themselves. Had an outbreak like this originated in a nation like Germany it’s very likely it would have been contained, or at the very least managed to a far greater degree, due to the simple fact that they would have been willing to cooperate with the global community. Additionally, there’s (limited) evidence that the Chinese may have leveraged the help of international bodies such as the World Health Organization in covering up the outbreak. These organizations take *a lot* of money from you and I in order to serve as an independent, objective investigative body with the sole purpose of verifying and reporting accurate data along with containing the outbreak at the epicenter. We will continue to look to organizations such as this one moving forward and will continue to place the planet’s trust in their ability to maintain an objective and pure goal towards promoting global health and disease containment. It’s *hugely*’important to our global community’s safety that organizations such as this one remain un-compromised. 2. Why not laterBecause now is better. In a situation like this where the disease hasn’t hit a critical point of being completely and utterly out of control (think 20 million sick Americans instead of 1.5) and we seem to be able to continue with a modified lifestyle until a vaccine or cure is discovered, it’s worth the limited resources required to open an investigation into what happened in China, how the WHO may or may not have been involved, and work towards determine an appropriate punishment (should there be one) and reorganization of the way we and international bodies approach novel outbreaks. Additionally, the longer we wait, the more evidence “the fire” burns. We have the resources and the capability to investigate the CCP, the WHO, and the other necessary bodies, and to wait would only mean it’ll be more difficult to ascertain what truly happened. On another note, and relating back to the original intent of this thread, my displeasure with the Democratic Party has been entirely in their insistence and public demands that the Trump Administration be investigated for its response to a virus that’s been confirmed to have arrived here Dec 31st of last year while the CCP was reporting a handful of cases. *That’s* the kind of politicization of a crisis that I have an issue with - if they had a shred of interest in determining who the guilty party is, they’d be demanding, with much greater fervor, that the CCP be investigated for what seems to be a very deliberate and coordinated effort to silence any word of the impending coronavirus outbreak.",,,1589844828,{},fr2vqmx,False,t3_gm1hzy,False,True,t1_fr2s9g3,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/gm1hzy/eric_trump_seemed_to_suggest_that_the_virus_is_an/fr2vqmx/,1589851685,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1589844828.0,,

We used to write letters to Japanese soldiers pretending to be their loved ones at home, or vice versa, to spread rumors of deaths and affairs. People will do the same to us. At this point the people who are calling everyone racists are basically cooperating with enemy propaganda aims. It’s not intentionally. It’s not criminal. We don’t need to over react, but we need to start acknowledging that it really isn’t helping and find a way to guide Americans to the light of the liberal democracy that could work together that we used to be. Nobody wakes up a Wednesday and decides that today is the day that they are going to call people racist over saying where something is from. That is a struggling person. Treating their acting out as a serious contribution to the political debate will only be enabling mental illness. This stuff hurts people. It hurts to get called racist. It hurts to have to call people who aren’t racists, racists. Sidebar, yes there is racism in America. Saying it isn’t there doesn’t help, but neither does pointing to where it isn’t and saying “look, there it is.”At any rate, as a nation we need to deescalate with each other at some point.

Please, let’s stop the rabid racism accusations, the America bashing, and the CCP apologetics. The world has gotten massively better than it used to. Less people are starving and more people are loving decent lives. More people are free to have opinions and get involved in politics than every before.

China as a superpower would certainly not accept any kind of help similar to the response given with Ebola, as that would reflect poorly on CCP domestically.That's a possibility, but it's difficult thing to speculate. Would China see it as a threat from the US under Trump vs Obama? I would argue under Obama there is a much higher chance of China being ok with allowing doctors and other healthcare workers to help stem the crisis, especially if the US is paying for some of it. Probably no military aid would be allowed, which would be different than with Ebola, but other aid I think has a shot of being accepted.&gt;So with no options for sending in teams we would have poor understanding of how covid19 behaves early on. That also limits preemptively measurements to things like shutting down travel to and from China, followed up with recommended quarantine periods for people returning from international destinations. Let's assume for a second China didn't allow anyone to help under Obama. Does that mean the rest of what happened follows? No, I would say it's unlikely. For starters, Obama's administration would have very likely taken the spread seriously from the start. They may not have imposed travel restrictions on China as early as Trump tbh, but I'm fairly certain they would have requested quarantine measures and testing capabilities be spun up on every possible source. Since that is what they did for Ebola. Moreover, helping in China might not have been an option, but helping in Italy and South Korea and Iran could have definitely been possible. Remember, those were the next hotspots for the virus spread. Even just Obama drawing significant attention to the crisis early on could have controlled the spread, pressuring states to do whatever they could to limit the disease count. Just look at South Korea for how this could have been handled. They have barely 10,000 cases, and they had their first known case the same day as the US. Do you really think for a second the US under Obama wouldn't have acted the same way as South Korea? Because that just seems like pessimistic thinking to be pessimistic. That administration had plans upon plans to deal with such a threat, and went through mock scenarios to try to figure out how best to stop such a crisis. And they even briefed the incoming Trump administration on the whole process. So clearly they thought it was a very high priority. Trump in turn, from the sound of it, took all that work, saw it had ""Obama"" written on it, and threw it in the trash. He removed the pandemic response people from the National Security Council, tried multiple times to defund the CDC, gutted basically every person within his government who could have warned him about this or convinced him to take it seriously, and then denied the problem was even a problem for over a month. His response just has been catastrophically bad in my mind, and has lead to thousands of needless deaths. &gt;The density difference in place where it stroke would certainly also add a greater infection rate, allowing for unknown carriers bringing it out of the country. Density isn't actually that much different between Wuhan and the West African cities Ebola was in. Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, where the first cases began to spread, has a [population density of 1,224 people per square kilometer](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/sierra-leone-population/), whereas the city Wuhan has a [population density of about 1,200 people per square kilometer](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/wuhan-population/). Conakry, Guinea's capital and the location of the first phase of the outbreak, has a [much higher population density at 10,500 inhabitants per square kilometer](https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital-facts-for-conakry-guinea/). Monrovia in Liberia has [a bit lower population density at 7,400 ppsk](https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital-facts-for-monrovia-liberia/), but is still several times higher than Wuhan. All three of these cities were the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, so it's not correct to say that population density is dramatically different in Wuhan, China than these African cities. And likely their healthcare infrastructure is less robust than in China, so that means treatment and education on the virus might have lead to even higher infection rates, not lower ones.  &gt;This is not an endorsement of Trumps response, that I agree have been unsatisfying , but I don't see Obama or any other president avoiding it getting to the US and spreading. Again, I'd like to point to countries that have taken this virus seriously from the start and down a great job of containing it; South Korea, Iceland, Taiwan, Japan, Canada.

Again, estimates showed there were going to be over 1 million Ebola cases in less than a year from the start of the outbreak if people didn't act quickly. It was already spreading to major countries, as there were infected cases in Nigeria, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the US. They were very small numbers because they were very well contained, but still they did happen. I think the biggest difference is that for coronavirus, people seem to be able to spread the disease asymptomatically, which I don't think is the case with Ebola. But that doesn't mean the disease can't spread by plane or other travel. As I said in another post, the rate of infection was comparable to the Spanish Flu, which obviously ripped through the global population.

Before Trump, Huawei - which is essentially a front for CCP intelligence - was going to provide 5g across Europe and the West. Now, Meng Wanzou (CFO and daughter of the founder) is on house arrest one Canada awaiting extradition to the US to be tried. And country after country is pulling out of their talks with Huawei to provide 5g.  &gt;  &gt;That would never have happened under Obama, especially with Biden in control of our China policy.There was a scathing bipartisan report put out by Congress in 2012 about Huawei's tight connection with the Chinese government.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/us/us-panel-calls-huawei-and-zte-national-security-threat.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/us/us-panel-calls-huawei-and-zte-national-security-threat.html) Some quotes:&gt; In the latest development to highlight the sensitive terrain that the United States and China are navigating on economic issues, a House committee issued a blistering bipartisan report on Monday that accused two of China’s largest telecommunications companies of being arms of the government that had stolen intellectual property from American companies and could potentially spy on Americans.    &gt;  &gt;President Obama has also taken a tougher stance on China recently. Late last month, Mr. Obama, through the Committee on Foreign Investment, ordered a Chinese company to divest itself of interests in four wind farm projects near a Navy base in Oregon where drone aircraft training takes place. It was the first time a president had blocked such a deal in 22 years.  &gt;  &gt;The Obama administration has also filed a case at the World Trade Organization in Geneva accusing China of unfairly subsidizing its exports of autos and auto parts, the ninth trade action the administration has brought against China.  &gt;  &gt;“We have a process that is not aimed at one specific company but using all the assets and parts of U.S. government aimed at protecting our telecommunications and critical infrastructure,” a senior White House official said.&amp;#x200B;&gt;Representative Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Representative C. A. Ruppersberger of Maryland, the top Democrat on the committee.  &gt;  &gt;They said that the United States government should be barred from doing business with Huawei and ZTE and that American companies should avoid buying their equipment.Does that sound like what you are describing? Or were people already strongly against Huawei in 2012?\---In 2014, it came out that the Obama/Biden administration directed the NSA to hack into Huawei servers as part of dealing with the security threat they posed.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/world/asia/nsa-breached-chinese-servers-seen-as-spy-peril.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/world/asia/nsa-breached-chinese-servers-seen-as-spy-peril.html) Some quotes:&gt;American officials have long considered Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, a security threat, blocking it from business deals in the United States for fear that the company would create “back doors” in its equipment that could allow the Chinese military or Beijing-backed hackers to steal corporate and government secrets.  &gt;  &gt;But even as the United States made a public case about the dangers of buying from Huawei, classified documents show that the National Security Agency was creating its own back doors — directly into Huawei’s networks.&amp;#x200B;&gt;Washington’s concerns about Huawei date back nearly a decade, since the RAND Corporation, the research organization, evaluated the potential threat of China for the American military. RAND concluded that “private Chinese companies such as Huawei” were part of a new “digital triangle” of companies, institutes and government agencies that worked together secretly.  &gt;They have blocked his company at every turn: pressing Sprint to kill a $3 billion deal to buy Huawei’s fourth generation, or 4G, network technology; scuttling a planned purchase of 3Com for fear that Huawei would alter computer code sold to the United States military; and pushing allies, like Australia, to back off from major projects.  &gt;  &gt;As long ago as 2007, the N.S.A. began a covert program against Huawei, the documents show. By 2010, the agency’s Tailored Access Operations unit — which breaks into hard-to-access networks — found a way into Huawei’s headquarters. The agency collected Mr. Ren’s communications, one document noted, though analysts feared they might be missing many of them.Doesn't this completely contradict what you were claiming about the US and  Huawei?

They listed unintended effects as travelers lying, governments withholding information, economic consequences, societal impact, and fear and stigma.  The CCP reference in the article states, ""The Chinese Communist Party’s official mouthpiece, the People’s Daily, called the ban 'racist.'""  When you click on the link, the quote in the article actually says: Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. “It’s truly mean.”  I'm not sure if I'm missing another quote, but regardless it's China, not what TSers are referencing.The WHO did not specify Trump in their recommendations on travel, nor was it a new position.  The position of the WHO is multifactorial, partly based on experience with other infectious diseases like HIV, SARS, TB, Ebola, etc.  Also, they did not specify Trump or the US or actively criticizing the bans.  https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/11/coronavirus-fact-check-donald-trump-vs-world-health-organization/5128799002/If you care to read an actual study on travel restriction effectiveness here you go http://www9.who.int/bulletin/volumes/92/12/14-135590/en/It's a complicated issue, but what isn't complicated is that they literally did not single out the US or form a new position because of Trump.

China pays their soldiers *one ninth* of what we pay and don't count healthcare for families/retirees in their budget (these alone account for $152b of the [$382b difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures). * Despite how big and advantageous our military is we spend a lower percentage of our GDP than Russia, our closest rival. Like a billionaire who spends 1mil on security vs a millionaire who spends 100k. The billionaire is spending more in absolute terms but a much smaller slice of what he has. Now consider what we get with that smaller slice of GDP. The superior technology (military and public), protection of allies, jobs and family healthcare, humanitarian work, safe waterways, army core of engineer projects, GPS, the most peaceful era in history, and the best security in the galaxy. * We pay our soldiers relatively well (compared to China/Russia), better benefits, equipment, training, the largest logistical backbone on the planet, etc. This is actually a huge part of the military budget, much bigger than actual procurement (new equipment). * The technological innovations that have come from the military have been massive and difficult to put a price tag on (we're using many of them to have this conversation). * The most powerful weapon in our military is precisely that it is overwhelming. The cost of never having to use an expensive overly dominant military is cheaper than the cost of possibly having to use a cheaper kinda better one.* We spend a lot of money on developing smart weapons so that we minimize collateral damage. Other countries will spend less and just carpet bomb their enemy. This may not be ""economically productive"" but it is moral. * We have hospital ships we send to humanitarian crises.

We pay voluntary extra payments which fluctuate from year to year and go towards specific projects including but not limited to maternal health care initiatives as an example.  The voluntary payments bring our total contributions to around 400 million, but it's not appropriate to suggest that these payments are earmarked for pandemic prevention, anymore than it is appropriate to suggest the WHO's sole responsibility is pandemic prevention.  If we take the mandatory fees as those fees which are devoted to pandemic prevention (which is an extremely extremely extremely charitable assumption to take, given the complexity of the WHO mission), then we're paying them less than trump is compensated for the privilege of having the Secret Service protect him at his hotels.You’re wholly misunderstanding what I said. I didn’t say “the WHO’s job is to prevent a pandemic.” I said “the WHO’s job is to make sure outbreaks of new diseases are dealt with to global standards and that the data recorded and shared from those outbreaks is accurate.” Where they failed, catastrophically, is in ensuring the data China was sharing was accurate, despite the fact Taiwan informed WHO officials that the outbreak was far, far worse than the CCP was reporting. So, in light of the above, which is not disputable - wouldn’t you agree that the world over, America included, would have been far more prepared to deal with this if either: China reported accurate numbers OR the WHO did their due diligence and found the CCP’s numbers to be inaccurate, and so reported? &gt; So trump is compensated more than the WHO is in order to protect us from myriad threats. Including pandemics.  Trump had intelligence in early January suggesting an extreme risk to the military from this.  A threat to the military is also likely an extreme threat to civilians.  trump had a duty to protect us for which he is compensated. He had knowledge or should have had knowledge of the threat. He failed, performing worse than many other countries that are significantly poorer than us by your own admission.This would hold water if the US wasn’t #20 globally on a per/capita basis for cases. That doesn’t account for the fact that, to state that, you need to believe the numbers being reported by China (already proven to be inaccurate), Iran, N Korea, Russia, etc. are accurate and true. Are you willing to stand by that statement?&gt; Given that your argument for firing the WHO is based on the same principles (duty to protect which it recieved compensation for, knowledge or should have known, failure to protect), why should we not defund trump, or fire him?Because then you’d need to apply that argument to every 1st world country across the globe, save for S Korea. The US is precisely average for how hard it has been hit relative to the rest of the globe. &gt; And not for nothing, but pulling funding from the WHO only allows other states, such as China, to take even more leadership in the organization.  If you want the WHO to be even more a tool of china, then Trump is accommodating that very nicely.  American leadership abroad is a better defense against a lot of threats than allowing tyrannical nations to assume those leadership positions.If that were to happen, other western countries would unquestionably follow suit and jump ship with the US.",,,1586928837,{},fngdd6u,False,t3_g1h9ml,False,True,t1_fngce1y,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/g1h9ml/how_do_you_feel_about_trump_halting_funding_to/fngdd6u/,1586953770,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1586928837.0,,

I have an extremely nuanced view of them.I live near a town with a high proportion of Chinese students. I have dated two - my ex, and my current GF of 3.5 years.I have been to China. I speak a non-trivial amount of Chinese (我说一千字). I know personally several CCP members (my GF's parents are both officers in the PLA - her dad is a colonel). Her uncle is a fairly important person at Chinese NASA.My ex-gf is from Wuhan (though currently she lives in Beijing). Her dad is a doctor there. I've asked her for on the ground information about Wuhan.Through these connections I've also made various Chinese friends who live in multiple cities throughout China whom I converse with semi-regularly. I am aware of nuanced perspectives that many Chinese people have on their government and how it works. My GF for example is not a huge fan of Xi and thinks he is in some ways taking her country backwards.Given my connection to China, which is a bit stronger than the average US citizen, what are my thoughts on this situation, and China generally?I think that the officials in Hubei province hid the infection at first - and that this was due to a systemic fault in the Chinese political system, that emphasizes not losing face if at all possible. That caused them to hide the infection until it had started spreading.I think that the national government actually had a pretty pro-active response when it was made aware of the infection. They shut down Wuhan and Hubei province at around 600-800 infected people. New York City and Seattle, with far more advanced warning, and a greater knowledge of how the virus progressed and how deadly it was, did not shut down their cities until much higher numbers of infected.I think that Chinese wet markets with exotic animals were at fault for starting this disease, and I applaud the Chinese government for shutting it down. All of the Chinese people I know are against this practice, and as far as I can tell it seems to be a minority of citizens - almost all upper middle class individuals ""fronting"" - trying to show off how cool they are to social media - that are eating these animals.I think that the human rights situation in Xinjiang is deplorable and that the Chinese government is acting horribly there. I think the organ harvesting is straight evil.I think Xi is both good and bad for China. I think that his leadership will likely lead to greater economic growth. I also think that his leadership will lead to greater oppression and suppression of dissidents and I certainly don't support that. The Chinese people, most of whom have been poor until relatively recently, and who have seen 10x private GDP growth over the past 20 years, seem to see it as an acceptable, but not necessarily desirable trade-off. A lot of younger people don't like Xi that much.As for having been in China? It's substantially less repressive than you see in the media. I could go anywhere I pleased, drink anywhere (even the Great Wall, though they make you buy the beer on the wall), buy anything anywhere - if anything, it felt like much of Chinese society was ruleless - not draconian. Yeah, political protests or posting things against the government on social media to huge number of followers is typically treated pretty harshly - **which I want to be clear, I STRONGLY do not support** - but for the average person on the street, life is pretty normal.And as for the Chinese whistleblower? I don't think he was killed. The national government's response on this has been, as I've mentioned, to take it pretty damn seriously. It was entirely the Hubei government that tried to persecute and bother him, and their entire leadership got fired due to this.So rather than claiming that ""liberals"" defend the CCP, maybe ask who you're talking to first - I'm not defending them, I'm giving off my nuanced perspective as someone who is, well, maybe not an expert on China, but certainly an expert as far as Americans on Reddit are concerned.",,,1584726504,{},fl1cw0v,False,t3_flvcy7,False,True,t1_fl197sp,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/flvcy7/what_do_you_think_of_trump_crossing_out_corona_in/fl1cw0v/,1584728007,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,,1584726504.0,,
