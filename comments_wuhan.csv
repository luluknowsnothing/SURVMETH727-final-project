You literally just changed everything about it and I really want to make sure you understand what you just did with that statement.  &gt;a massive federally-led nationwide logistics effort (akin to the runup to WW2) to procure PPE and other medical supplies; instead states were left to fight with each other, with the federal government occasionally stepping in to hijack shipments.[We had that.  We did that.](https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-supply-chain-stabilization-task-force)  The logistical results were that our entire supply lines were completely decimated because the primary supply lines we were getting for these products was out of China.  Based on the logistics of the time, there was no practical way to manage the amount of PPE needed without any supply lines.  The fastest way to get PPE was to have it go directly through the states.  That's what the logistics concluded because we didn't have the supply lines in place. Once the supply lines were in place, that's when FEMA took over with the distribution of the PPE and other products.  &gt;We should have had a unified message around mask wearing and social distancing, not this half-assed response from the president and others making it seem like a point of personal choice and freedom. We did have unified message coming from the federal government however democrats were spreading information that was not following the protocols set by the experts representing the response at the federal level.  This isn't Trump making these determinations.  These are the experts at the NHS and CDC making them.  If you want to bark about experts, then maybe realize that we were trying to follow them but because democrats were trying everything they could to make this about Trump, it's resulted in mixed messages and people like you who believe that we didn't have a message coming out from the federal government.  Don't forget, the initial data coming out was that masks didn't work.&gt;We needed unified guidelines for when a particular county or state is too hot and needed a shutdown or just a mandate to only have outdoor activity. That's the job of the state governor.  That STATE GOVERNOR, not the federal government.  This is how our government functions.  The federal government does not have the power to do what you are asking.  It's entirely the job of the STATE GOVERNOR and through them the local governments.  I'm so sick and tired of people who just don't understand how our government works.&gt;We needed contact tracing.Good luck with that.  The only places that were able to successfully contact trace were countries with a fraction of the population of the US and they were going to the point of forcing people to stay in their homes under police orders for that.&gt;We needed travel restrictions - not the dog-whistle ""ban travel from China for non-Americans"" but ""everyone coming to America, even American citizens, gets a mandatory two-week quarantine in a real quarantine facility that doesn't just use shower curtains to isolate people from each other.""Come back to reality here.  You are bonkers right now.  You are literally making statements that are so incredibly wrong and crazy that it shows you have not done any research on this whatsoever.  Let's start with the first one, it wasn't a fucking dogwhistle.  Every case on record at that time had direct travel from Wuhan china.  Banning travel of foreign nationals who travelled through China was a logical, rational and useful step.  I honestly don't know any rational argument against this and anytime I hear someone try to deflect from it, I immediately know that they are doing it because of political reasons and not logical or rational ones.Let's look at the next step, you are advocating for preventing AMERICAN CITIZENS from being allowed access into their home country?  How do you not see just how completely irrational this is?  The federal government can't do that.  That goes against countless laws and would be shot down by every single courthouse from coast to coast if they tried to do it.  You are advocating for something that is so ignorant of our laws that you should be ashamed of yourself.Honestly, I really think you need to research what you are talking about and that doesn't mean reading some media articles and thinking you are informed.

Plan for the effective, equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines because discovering isn’t enough if they get distributed like Trump’s testing and PPE fiascos.This is insubstantial criticism without an actual plan. Distribution is going to happen according to need - providers, elderly, then everyone else. We already know this, [this is part of the plan](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/09/16/trump-administration-releases-covid-19-vaccine-distribution-strategy.html). Distribution of the vaccine is a different beast than PPE or ventilators, and will likely happen as quickly as it can be produced. &gt;Invest $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.There is a plan already in place. See above. I would be shocked if it were not free (that hasn't been detailed in HHS response yet).&gt;As we enter the height of the political season, politics should play no role in determining the safety and efficacy of any vaccine. The following 3 principles should guide us: Put scientists in charge of all decisions on safety and efficacy; publicly release clinical data for any vaccine the FDA approves; authorize career staff to write a written report for public review and permit them to appear before Congress and speak publicly uncensored.1. [Scientists already are in charge of this.](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/22/fda-goes-public-on-private-covid-vaccine-approval-process-in-bid-to-gain-trust.html). &gt;&gt;""Vaccine development can be expedited. However, I want to stress that it cannot, and must not, be rushed,” said Dr. Marion Gruber, director of FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review, adding the agency would not lower its standards.""&gt;Ensure everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected — in America receives the protection and care they deserve, and consumers are not price gouged as new drugs and therapies come to market.He has absolutely no mechanism to do this, or plan to do so. Drugs will be approved in the way they are approved (slowly, and through the FDA) then medicare approves payment for them, then insurance companies approve them. This will likely be greatly expedited for any proven treatments for COVID (which are likely farther away than the vaccine).  &gt;5. Protect Older Americans and Others at High Risk.&gt;Joe Biden understands that Trump’s failed response has made older Americans and others at high-risk even more vulnerable.&gt;Establish a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force, as proposed by Senator Harris, to provide recommendations and oversight on disparities in the public health and economic response. At the end of this health crisis, it will transition to a permanent Infectious Disease Racial Disparities Task Force.I currently work in a hospital and can personally guarantee you that every institution already has this, and already has the data that would be available to such a task force, down to the local level at which they serve. Disparities that are occuring are mimicking known disparities which are likely more based on socioeconomics and health literacy - two problems which we in healthcare have been trying to solve for decades. A task force will not solve this, and this is fluff. &gt;Create the Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard that Americans can check in real-time to help them gauge whether local transmission is actively occurring in their zip codes. This information is critical to helping all individuals, but especially older Americans and others at high risk, understand what level of precaution to take.This actually was a plan that Ohio (where I'm at) had, but it actually violated HIPAA to publish zip codes of those infected, even for use of tracking the pandemic. We get district or city-wide data at best (that is written into HIPAA law actually that patient identifiers don't include city/county. &gt;Read Joe Biden’s previously released Plan for Older Americans, Plan for Supporting People with Disabilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Fact Sheet on How Joe Biden Would Help You Get Health Insurance Coverage During The COVID-19 Crisis.Will not address here&gt;6. Rebuild and expand the defenses that Trump has dismantled to predict, prevent, and mitigate pandemic threats, including those coming from China.&gt;Immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which was established by the Obama-Biden Administration and eliminated by the Trump Administration in 2018.[Eliminated because it was redundant](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/10/fact-check-white-house-didnt-fire-pandemic-response-2018/3437356001/) and re-absorbed into other positions within the government. Settled issue. &gt;Immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization, which — while not perfect — is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic.That's fine. &gt;Re-launch and strengthen U.S. Agency for International Development’s pathogen-tracking program called PREDICT, which Donald Trump cut.This was just really unfortunate timing. It was a $200m program which is a lot, with questionable efficacy at actually impacting pandemics. They had actually isolated a near relative of COVID among 160 other strains.&gt;&gt;Daszak said there are an estimated 1.7m mystery viruses in wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic, making the early detection of these diseases imperative for public health and economic reasons.This is, again, some monday-morning quarterback stuff. And (working in healthcare/research) is not actually promising data that they would have done anything productive to prevent the pandemic. &gt;Expand the number of CDC’s deployed disease detectives so we have eyes and ears on the ground, including rebuilding the office in Beijing, which shrunk dramatically under Trump.Is there evidence that there was a shortage of disease detectives? Or that they were in some way hindered to responding to COVID quickly enough? [This article from Jan 6](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-epidemiologist-wuhan-public-health-warnings/) indicates that they were aware of the outbreak days before the WHO announced, but were actually beaten by a canadian AI program. &gt;7. Implement mask mandates nationwide by working with governors and mayors and by asking the American people to do what they do best: step up in a time of crisis.Mask mandates are nearly ubiquitous and will be as unfollowed if they are mandated by the feds as they are by the states. &gt;Experts say that if 95% of Americans wear masks between now and December, we can save almost 70,000 lives. Joe has called on:&gt;Every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their household&gt;Every Governor to make that mandatory in their state&gt;Local authorities to also make it mandatory to buttress their state ordersMasks work. People should wear them and are dumb for not. How far are we willing to go to punish people who are suspicious of the whole thing, even if they're wrong? Fines, jail? This isn't a new plan, it's a centralized approach to a problem caused by people who don't want a centralized response. I don't think it will actually increase the number of people wearing masks, nor slow the spread of the virus just because he ""calls on us as americans"". Tl;dr - All in all - I think his plan is not practicably different from the current plan. The only thing that would change is media outlets would provide all of this context up front, so people would be less pissed-off. /rant.",,,1603428764,{},g9qawvu,False,t3_jg9tkl,False,True,t1_g9q8ab9,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/jg9tkl/second_presidential_debate_in_nashville_102220/g9qawvu/,1603434529,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1603428764.0,,,

The real problem is not the virus.  The real problem is fear and panic.  The fear initially started when China decided to (1) let people from Wuhan go to other countries freely and (2) started welding people into their homes in Wuhan.  This maximized the spread of the virus, as well as maximizing fearful reaction, since people assumed that it must be truly scary if China is willing to weld people into their homes.  Since initial data wasn't very good, it looked much worse than it was initially.  Given the initial strong fear reaction from the general population and the initial scientific models indicating something to be afraid of, it's understandable that politicians initially thought of it as an emergency.  It's even understandable that we started an unprecedented and extreme measure of doing a lockdown, because we thought we were looking at a disease of unprecedented and extreme deadliness.  Our initial goal was ""15 days to slow the spread"".  The idea was, since stopping the virus entirely was impossible, we ought to slow the spread down so that the same number of people would get infected over a longer stretch of time, and therefore our hospitals wouldn't get slammed with such a large number of cases in such a short time that they'd run out of hospital beds, and start having to make triage decisions about who to treat and who not to treat.  This, too, was grounded in reality.  In Italy, they did run into a capacity shortage, and they had to start turning away older people with high mortality rates.  I don't think we knew at the time that the reason Italy had this problem was a combination of (1) an older population than average in the region, (2) a population of Chinese people from Wuhan, (3) high air pollution in the region, and (4) low hospital capacity due to their system of socialized medicine.  If we had, perhaps we would have been able to predict that this would only happen there, and was not a danger elsewhere.  Up until the initial 15 days to slow the spread, everything makes sense.  We were overreacting, but we were overreacting to something that, with the limited knowledge we had, legitimately seemed like a great danger.  From there on, it was downhill.  The MSM could get loads of clicks on the internet for pushing fear.  So they did.  Politicians started reacting to early, scary information with draconian measures, thereby gaining approval from frightened constituents.  And so they ignored later information that indicated they had made a mistake.  After all, that would involve admitting error and facing the wrath of their constituents.  The MSM, who hate Donald Trump with the fiery passion of a thousand suns, also noted that if the virus was made to seem bad, Trump would be made to seem bad too.  So they only looked for information that was scary or bad, or even just seemed that way, or could be twisted to seem that way.  And they reported that to the population.  Who became more frightened.  And many politicians saw their opportunity to grab power and to dictate to the people what they must do, subject only to their whims.  The best of politicians like power too much, and the worst of them are addicted to it, like a drug.  The worst of them tried to set themselves up as petty tyrants, and made many arbitrary decrees, which they themselves didn't obey, because this had nothing to do with the virus, and had everything to do with feeding their addiction to [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg14jNbBb-8).  The politicians' arbitrary decrees fed the fear of the population, as did the MSM's campaign of fear.  Slowly, the evidence mounted that the virus was not nearly as bad as it had been portrayed.  The MSM didn't say anything about it.  Big Tech suppressed it.  But more and more people noticed bits and pieces of this information as it began to trickle out.  The right noticed first, due to our pre-existing distrust of the MSM and Big Tech, though some elements of the far left also noticed, since they share that distrust.  People started noticing that the virus doesn't spread exponentially, that many people have T-cell cross immunity, that the evidence that masks work is inconclusive, that there is no evidence that lockdowns work, that more draconian measures were implemented at times when things were getting better, that the hospitals simply weren't getting slammed as we'd feared, that there was a huge cost in preventing people from going to hospitals for other health problems, that places with the least lockdowns did the best, that asymptomatic people don't spread it, that it poses far less risk than lockdowns, especially to children, who were being kept out of school for no reason, that power-hungry governors weren't following their own orders, that arbitrary measures that don't make sense were being imposed on religious gatherings, and religious gatherings only, and so on, and so on, and so on.  Then riots erupted across the country, mass gatherings with enormous numbers of people, all over the country, for months.  The MSM and politicians told us that [this was fine](https://babylonbee.com/news/cnn-hires-this-is-fine-dog-to-report-on-riots).  Reporters stood in front of burning buildings and called the riots ""fiery, but mostly peaceful protests"".  What they didn't do was act like they actually thought all those things they'd been telling us about the virus were true.  If they had been telling the truth about the virus, these gatherings would have been a terrible danger, and they would have sent in riot police to arrest and quarantine everyone in sight.  They would have been in a panic, lest the virus spread.  Instead, they pretended everything was fine, and did nothing.  The MSM and politicians told us, through their inaction, that what they were saying about the virus just wasn't true.  So Trump was faced with a situation where there was a mildly dangerous virus, and a severely dangerous epidemic of fear.

Worse he kept holding crowded rallies even though he knew those people were in deadly danger. How would you feel if it had been you or a friend / family member who got sick after attending one of those rallies which made no effort to socially distance or promote mask wearing?Look at the response from countries like South Korea and New Zealand, do you believe they made the wrong choices?&gt;I realize that Trump was actually impeached. Poor wording, I guess, but he wasn't actually ""convicted"". ""Impeachment"" is pretty much synonymous with ""charged"", which doesn't matter because he was ""found not guilty"". I feel it's a bit pedantic of a point, but okay, my wording was incorrect.I don't mention it to be pedantic, but rather because the Senate trial was unusual in that before it even started [GOP senators made it clear that they were not interested in the facts or a fair trial:](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/12/mitch-mcconnell-impeachment-senate-trial-not-impartial-juror)&gt;McConnell told reporters Tuesday that the political nature of impeachment means he's not even going to pretend to be fair or impartial on impeachment, no matter what the facts dictate or the oath he swears to uphold. “I'm not an impartial juror,” McConnell said. “This is a political process. There is not anything judicial about it. Impeachment is a political decision . . . **I'm not impartial about this at all.”** The Senate leader was also fully willing to embrace his hypocrisy when a reporter presented McConnell with a quote he said during Bill Clinton's impeachment, in which McConnell supported impeachment witnesses testifying at the trial and said the practice was “certainly not unusual.” (McConnell is now pushing for a short trial without witnesses, and rejected Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's opening request to call several Trump administration officials to testify.)&gt;...&gt;The majority leader's blatant view of impeachment as a “partisan exercise” that has no room for actual justice, of course, is not a huge surprise, given that McConnell has emphasized his close coordination with the Trump administration in the lead-up to the trial. **“Everything I do during this, I will be coordinating with White House counsel,”** McConnell told Fox News last week, adding that there will be **“no difference between the president’s position and our position as to how to handle this.”** Nor is McConnell the first GOP senator to openly boast of his plans to throw justice and impartiality out the window. Senator Lindsey Graham, another key Trump ally, has also made it clear that his mind is made up on how he'll decide the president's fate (despite outright refusing to pay attention to any of the testimony from the House Intelligence Committee's impeachment witnesses). “This thing will come to the Senate, and it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly,” Graham said Saturday in an interview at the Doha Forum in Qatar. **“I am trying to give a pretty clear signal I have made up my mind. I'm not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here.”**If you were on trial for something and before it even began the jurors announced they would not consider the evidence, were coordinating with the legal team against you, and already decided on the outcome with no pretence of acting fair (even though they will take an oath stating the opposite), how would you feel about that?&gt;I'm fairly certain that I had Covid19 back in December. I doubt it unless you were in Wuhan, since [""The outbreak was detected by Wuhan doctors only in late December.""](https://apnews.com/e9fe85641b93d447dfd529095c2640e4)&gt;Back then, WHO had knowledge of the dangers of it, were being told by Taiwan that it was serious, but didn't recognize it as a credible threat because China was downplaying it. I'm more mad at WHO for taking so long to call it a threat than I am at Trump.If other people do something wrong, that clearly doesn't excuse Trump's faults. Besides, this isn't true. From my link above:&gt;TRUMP: “The World Health Organization consistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal. The World Health Organization failed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government’s official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself.” — May 18 letter.&gt;THE FACTS: No such study existed in December, according to the Lancet. The Lancet said the first papers it published on the coronavirus came from Chinese and Hong Kong researchers on Jan. 24.&gt;WHO was alerted to a “cluster of atypical pneumonia” via media reports and its own surveillance system on Dec. 31, and it requested information from China on Jan. 1. “In the first weeks of January WHO was very, very clear; we alerted the world on Jan. 5th,” Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program, told reporters on April 15. “Systems around the world, including in the U.S., began to activate their emergency management systems on January 6th.”What are your thoughts on this?&gt;Back in March, Italy was being hit hard. Anyone with half a brain cell should have known it was serious. Anyone who needed Trump to say it, is an idiot. Anyone who brushed it off because of Trump, is an idiot.Unfortunately there are a lot of idiots and [many of them believed Trump and other Republicans:](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/09/10/kristin-urquiza-donald-trump-coronavirus-response-bob-woodward-book/3459196001)&gt;Trump knew weeks before the first confirmed U.S. coronavirus death that COVID-19 was highly contagious and more deadly than the flu, according to a new book by journalist Bob Woodward. Yet, when addressing the public, he claimed the virus was ""under control"" and would soon disappear. ""The president is on record lying,"" Urquiza, whose father died of COVID-19 in June, told The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. ""It’s undeniable, and it’s inexcusable.""&gt;...&gt;""We’re taught to follow our leaders especially during times of crisis. For people like my dad, he trusted Donald Trump, he trusted (Arizona) Gov. Doug Ducey,"" Urquiza said. ""When they, in May, decided to lie to the public and say that it was safe to go out and to resume normal activities, my father followed their advice. For that, he paid with his life.""Such people increased the spread making it more dangerous for everyone. Do you think these people deserve to die because they were lied to?&gt;I don't need audio recordings. There are countless videos and pictures of Democrat leaders not wearing masks while berating Trump for not wearing one.Again, the actions of others don't excuse Trump's. There is a difference between not wearing a mask and deliberately lying to people as Trump did. I'm open to learning so could you provide a source for this?&gt;Hell, there is a video of Biden in a church (which were closed for other people) not wearing a mask.

So just to set the stage here let’s look at the timeline of what was going on with covid in relation to when Trump gave this interview. Wuhan went on lockdown January 23rd. Europe’s first corona death was February 14th. Shit hit the fan in Italy at the beginning of March. In Trumps interview he gave on February 7th he said I just talked to Xi, this is a very dire virus that is transmitted through the air and is worse than the flu and has a 5% CFR. All of this is what the narrative was coming out of Wuhan, this is what Xi told him, and this is all the info he had available. This is before China was even letting The Who in as well and no other deaths have occurred around the world. At this point, The only info Trump had about the virus is what was coming out of communist China, and it was also in Chinas best interest to hype of the virus so other countries would shut down their economies likeChina did. Trumps actions, Feb 2nd. Shut down travel from China (which Biden called racist and Pelosi told people to go eat in China town or whatever). Feb 3 , Trump admin declares public health emergency. Trump partnered with Tesla , GE, Ford to produce ventilators, now we have to many. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/18/ventilators-coronavirus-stockpile/%3foutputType=ampThe US also locked down when it needed to under Trump and along with it crashed the economy (trumps baby) while countries like Sweden, embraced herd immunity and didn’t shut down at all. Trump did a lot more with operation warp speed, atm it’s looking like the US will have the first vaccine that passes phase 3 trials. Trump appointed Fauci, and the coronavirus task force. Looking at Trumps actions , it seems like a good response and pretty in line with what he said in his February 7th interview. In terms of his rhetoric, there could be an argument there that he could have possibly misled the public but in my opinion, I think it was appropriate at the time as to not cause panic. If he would have came out and said what he said In his interview to the public , it most likely would have caused a degree of panic that would have prevented hospitals from securing the PPE they needed and would have caused mayham and runs on gas stations and grocery stores. After the US appropriately shut down, we and the rest of the world got more data and we figured out that the virus is really only “bad” for people with pre existing conditions , or elderly folks and it wasn’t worth it / viable to keep our economy shut down, Trumps rhetoric then changed and you see his similar to the flu, not that bad, democrats are using it to shutdown the economy and keep me from getting elected etc. We also now have proof and more data that what Trump has been saying was actually correct. I personally have issues with the whole mask issue about how Trump was so against it and thought he would look weak wearing one but in my opinion, that’s the only thing he should be on the hook for. When push came to shove he did what he had to do. The news is just trying to spin this early interview he gave back before the first death even happened outside of China when the virus was unknown and scary to contradict his rhetoric on the virus after we already shut down and were opening back up when the virus wasn’t unknown and scary anymore.I also saw somewhere that Fauci came out yesterday and denounced this whole narrative.",,,1599754724,{},g4pc83o,False,t3_ipk8rv,False,True,t3_ipk8rv,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/ipk8rv/what_are_your_thoughts_on_trump_privately_calling/g4pc83o/,1599762328,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1599754724.0,1599754940.0,,

Prior to this, note that the peak you are likely referring to is around early April, at least according to the 7 day average on [graphs on Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/).| Statement | Date || ------------ | ------ || The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said previously that there had been no human-to-human transmission of the illness. ^[1] | January 5 || “From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit. ^[2] | January 14|| Dr. Fauci: ""The coronavirus is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is not something that the citizens of the United States, right now, should be worried about. | January 21 || Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in China’s Guangdong province had been caused by human-to-human transmission and medical staff had been infected. ^[3] | January 21 || One confirmed case in Vietnam had no travel history to any part of China but wasa family member of a confirmed case who visited Wuhan. This suggests an instance of human to human transmission that occurred in Vietnam. ^[4] | January 24 || The Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern). ^[5] | January 30 || The declaration of a public health emergency enables the government to take temporary measures to contain the spread of the virus, which has been confirmed in seven people in the U.S. ^[6] | January 31 || Fauci and the CDC emphasised the importance of physical distancing and, in line with the evolving public health recommendations, added that cloth face coverings should be used in public.^[7] | April 3 |Clearly, there was a change in guidelines around the peak and that was in addition to the several guidelines of physical distancing already in place. This does not appear to have significantly deterred the virus either as the 7-day average remained rather high (at the time) through the following days.[1] - BBC News. 2020.

I've mentioned that I'm in Florida, and I can tell you that the spikes aren't much fun - and this is coming from someone who's actually _enjoying_ quarantine. &gt; A small aside just to give you a bit of my perspective. Congratulations. Welcome to the prepper club, we're glad to have you! I also spent January and February stocking up. Nothing crazy, no hoarding, just being prudent. Though, I still haven't run out of toilet paper. &gt; When should we have expected our government to prepare and react to a novel virus.Honestly, about when they did. China locked down Wuhan on January 23rd, reporting extremely low numbers of infections, and, with the WHO, swore they had it under control. There was little reason not to believe them - they'd done a reasonable job controlling prior influenza breakouts in recent years, and we didn't know they were lying until much later. On February 3rd, your government still considered it ""discriminatory"" to deny entry to travelers from China. WHO didn't declare a pandemic until March 11th, mere days before US states began to limit businesses and schools. Could they have known sooner? Sure, but thanks to some seriously misplaced trust in fellow developed nations and international organizations, they didn't. &gt; Should the Trump administration have taken it seriously then? I would argue that the ban showed Trump was taking it seriously.I would agree. For as much flak as President Trump takes about his various travel bans (and, let's remember, this one earned him heaps of international condemnation), this one was perfectly justifiable. &gt; We kept up the voluntary part through to April. Few were concerned in Canada.They were well behind the ball, then. My state was entirely locked down by our Governor by April. &gt; By the end of March, I believe, both Canada and the US should’ve known how awful this would get.I would say they had a pretty good idea. Most US states were under lock own orders by the end of March. Canada closed it's borders to all but Canadian citizens on March 18th. Market prices for PPE were starting to rise due to demand. Things were in full swing by the first week of April or so. &gt; I haven’t checked Florida’s cases recently, how is it going there? In my province we were in level III opening. That means bars and restaurants with restrictions were open.We're currently fighting for the title ""hottest hotspot on Earth"", so not extremely great. Everything is open except bars, and I think it's extremely unlikely that we'll see any further restrictions, since folks are generally ignoring the few that are in place. People are only really wearing masks when companies (grocery and hardware stores, mostly), not government, ask them to. I'm very thankful that I don't live in one of the big cities, it's much worse there than here, but even so I don't leave my property unless I have to. &gt; On a personal note, I’m really getting sick of my own cooking, I’m even sick of my wife’s cooking.I'll give you the most American gift I can, then - some down-home American country cooking. Brown a half-kilo of ground sausage (breakfast sausage works best, but nearly any will do) in a pan with some diced onion. Let the fat render, and keep it in the pan - the more the better. Once the sausage is browned, stir in a quarter cup of flour, then a half-liter of whole milk, and some ground black pepper. Keep stirring over medium heat, until it reduces to the consistency of a nice, thick gravy. Salt and pepper to taste. This is the famed ""country gravy"" that is, apparently, uniquely American, and an absolute staple of the South. Serve over nice, flaky biscuits for our traditional fare. Also makes a great dinner over white rice, fries, or tater tots. &gt; But even wanting this to be over doesn’t stop me from ensuring that I’m taking the precautions necessary to keep myself and my wife.I hear you. I've got a couple of young kids in the mix too, and the state opening the schools next month has everyone on edge. Keep doing the right thing for you and your family. I think it's fair to say that this whole situation has shown we can't really trust our governments to keep us safe from COVID, so we've got to do what we can for ourselves, and hope they stumble across a good idea every once in awhile. Hang in there, you can do this. &gt; When do you think this became a priority for your federal govt?When it became a priority for the people, same as with any emergency. They care about what we (collectively) care about, because that's how they stay in office, and what we don't care about _en-masse_, they ignore. They might have had a few extra weeks before the panic truly set in, but taking sweeping actions like locking down entire states wouldn't have helped. We aren't big fans of social welfare programs, so locking down is basically ordering the poor into hopelessness.

Also, I am an Asian American. Specifically, from Chinese / Vietnamese descent but I was born and raised in CA.  I do have many Asian friends and of course family. I can see that people think some of trumps words are racially motivated but I don’t think that trump himself is racist. The one that maybe irks me the most is kung flu, I mean I also think it’s a funny term not to be taken seriously but I can see how others aren’t happy with that statement. China virus, wuhan virus doesn’t bother me, ones attacking Asian people on the streets are idiot racists that are irrationally fearful and should be individually be held responsible. Trump started calling it the China virus partly because China was trying to blame our military as the root cause for it, trump has never said to go attack asians. In the other things trump says: Mexicans are racists, when I watch the full speech he was saying that the people illegally coming from the border, there are people who are criminals which is factual, america has a drug problem and there is a problem with the cartels and human trafficking. He didn’t go around saying all Mexicans are bad people, he even pointed to those in the crowd who were Hispanic and saying they’re not sending good people like you, you, you. He is pro legal immigration and doesn’t like illegal immigration.I think it depends on your perspective of either dividing or uniting America in some instances. I would also argue that his policies are uniting America. For example his immigration policies are pro America / Americans first but the way it’s portrayed to the left is that he hates POC and wants to divide us. Trump cares less about foreign affairs and wants to put America first which I have no problems with. Trump is consistent in his policies to put America first. I think with so much crap that’s going on and in the recent past, we have become the global police and get involved in things that we do not need or should be involved with. I agree that trump doesn’t care that he’s not politically correct, for the most part, trump supporters also don’t care that he isn’t because it goes back to the his policies are good. I think the next question as you mentioned is “is trump harmful for political norms” again I think it depends on perspective, if you are for how politics were done in the past, then yes he is absolutely harmful but I think many supporters were tired of the old political norm where politicians from both sides put on a fake persona in front of you and do shady things behind your back not even putting a good faith attempt to keep some of their promises. Trump was elected in part because people have been increasingly growing tired of the seemingly corrupt political norm. One thing to note is that conservatives were increasingly silenced in their viewpoints and have been told they are evil, or in Hillary’s words, Deplorable just for a difference in opinion. Dialogue seemed to be decreasing, example of this is universities blocking conservative speakers like Ben Shapiro citing “hate speech”. For me at least, it’s less of a Democrat vs republican thing, i would be more sympathetic if there was a democratic candidate that had the same background as trump saying the same things as trump. So no, I don’t think I can list 5 things trump does that would bother me if it was done by a Democrat partly because many of it was done by a Democrat before. Also, I’m probably a little nicer to the left than most trump supporters. Though I do think Obama abused the powers of the office and a lot of things the left is outraged about have been done in the Obama administration example but it was done to their favor. Examples: abuse of executive orders, Muslim travel ban, deportation of illegal immigrants, etc. republicans voiced their opposition to these things and the left just laughed and dismissed it.

I live in CA and from many of my liberal friends, they only watch clips from CNN, Trevor Noah, and other liberally biased news. In my opinion many of the clips portray trump out of context and would cut bits and pieces of what he says and call him a racist, bigot, etc etc. Both sides of the media calls out petty things, while they maybe comedic at times, I think mainstream media is pretty disgusting in pandering to their base. So I condemn both sides, it gets very petty and to me, is no longer news. From my liberal friends most of what they say about trump can be debunked. They would often times ask my opinion of what trump said/did and upon first glance it looks bad but when I view the full speech it’s typically taken out of context. Also, what matters more to me is what he means vs what he says. Biden has tons of gaffes too, bush was notorious for them, Obama was well spoken but I feel he lies a lot and I don’t agree with his policies but I admit he’s charismatic and politics aside could see myself being able to grab a beer and have a good conversation with him. I think if you already have a bias against someone, it is very hard to see past what he says and try to understand what he means. We could go back and forth all day with look: trump said this, I could refute it with look, Biden said this. I think if you were able to watch his speech with good faith or with a viewpoint of how a friend with speak, many would be able to see that it’s not so bad. Furthermore, we never thought of him as the politically correct president who wants to be super safe with what he says, deflecting questions with PC answers. Of course everyone is different and has differing experiences and perspectives but an example for me where others would be alarmed and deem trump racist is: I am an Asian American. I consider myself American because I was born and raised here, I’ve never been to China or Vietnam. The term China virus or wuhan virus does not bother me at all. China was trying to blame US military for the virus, trump answered back with it is the China virus it came from CHYNA!!! Though it may stir up some racists to treat Asian people poorly, I blame the individuals racists for the treatment and not trump. Trump has kind words for Asian Americans and does not denounce them, h is denouncing the Chinese government and their poor handling that created a worldwide pandemic. Trump didn’t give a call to action to attack asians. IMO, it’s something taken out of context and radicalized. It can happen to any leader, I don’t love that he keeps emphasizing China virus so he does lose a few points with me but I don’t think he hates Asian Americans.",,,1595562408,{},fz208nq,False,t3_hw3ewq,False,True,t1_fyzjmmy,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/hw3ewq/do_you_think_trump_will_win_the_election_why/fz208nq/,1595630525,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1595562408.0,,,

I wouldn't believe that number and I'd be shocked if they had actually done that many.  They love to inflate these numbers.  That said, it's not possible that China has conducted fewer than ~30 million tests based on verifiable practices and testing nobody is disputing, including the US with consulates and embassies in these cities.I'll lay that out here, skip to the last two paragraphs if you're willing to accept the 30 million number.During the first wave nearly every person in Wuhan was tested, and after a dozen cases popped up the entire city was tested.  That alone is a minimum of 14 million tests.  There's a consulate in Wuhan and they've said nothing about them lying about these practices.Additionally every single person is tested when they re-enter the country.  During the first wave over a million were tested in Beijing and when 50 new cases were found 3 minion people were tested.  The embassy is there and backs up those numbers.Another 6 million were performed in Guangdong (3 major cities), and around 3 million more in Shanghai.This is also completely ignoring anything happening outside of the country's four largest cities and Wuhan and we have arrived at a count of 26 million tests (plus every single person who has entered the country since March) done that nobody has disputed anywhere.  Plus we haven't even gotten to HuBei, outside of Wuhan.If you'll accept 30 million as a bare minimum estimate then China has conducted roughly the same number of tests as the US.  Proportionally it's about 1 test for every 11 American citizens and 1 test for every 45 Chinese citizens.Hope that explains what degree of testing China is doing.

I do however think the mishandling of the pandemic by his administration, as well as his own downplaying of the seriousness of the virus have resulted in far more deaths than we would have seen with proper management (and let's not forget that we are seeing **morbidity** in addition to **mortality** \-- basically death isn't the only bad thing that can happen to you).1. The Trump administration had quite a bit of time to prepare, did not prepare, and then claimed they could not have possibly known about the virus because of WHO suppression. I'm in medical school and we had a school-wide lecture on COVID (back then, called Wuhan virus I believe because there was no official name yet) at the end of *December.* A formal notification was given to the Trump Administration on January 3rd. Trump does not comment to the public on COVID until the end of January after the first case is confirmed. Trump continues to host rallies, showing to his supporters that he is not concerned about the outbreak. We have to remember that these behaviors shape public perception, especially among his supporters.2. The Trump administration rolled out regulations in early Feb. that the CDC was required to retest every positive COVID test. (I won't go too far into this, but the test was done by PCR -- I did PCRs in undergrad, any competent biology/microbiology grad student can do PCRs, it is simply not a difficult test requiring this much control). These regulations slowed down public health response considerably and wasted testing resources. Meanwhile, there is also a regulation that the testing reagents must come from the CDC (which again, as any bio grad student can tell you, is completely unnecessary, especially since the CDC published the primers they used for PCR testing, and these labs already had their own, identical, PCR reagents). Because of this regulation, the CDC needed to first acquire massive amounts of reagents and then ship them to public health labs around the country -- this was rolled out veeeeeeery slowly. We lost precious time here.3. Mid-Feb, the NSC drafts a memo on the need for quarantine measures and is scheduled to brief Trump. Trump cancels the briefing to go golfing in Florida. He spends the next week hosting 3-4 rallies and insists on twitter that the outbreak is completely under control. Trump claims cases will be zero by the end of Feb. By this time, our medical school warns us that we may be sent home at the end of March due to mishandling of the virus and the very real possibility of hospital overload. Doctors and scientists already knew the storm that was coming, Trump just ignored them. We are indeed sent home by the end of March and our hospital has record cases and an ICU at triple capacity by the end of April. I know this is completely anecdotal,  but I think describing the concern/fear/panic amongst doctors at this time, in comparison to the complacency of the Trump administration and Trump himself, illustrates a good point. Trump claims in early March that Democrats and doctors are ""fear mongering.""4. Early March, the Trump administration says they will tests one million people this week (please note, testing and contact tracing are basically the only ways besides universal quarantine to contain the spread of a pandemic). By the end of this week, 4,000 tests **total** have been completed. So, not quite 1 million. Fauci testifies to Congress that the lack of sufficient testing is dangerous to our country; Trump finally declares a national emergency by mid-March (\~75 days after the first U.S. case was reported). He also finally makes a few statements that this virus might actually be bad (lol). End of March, he finally says it might be worse than the flu, despite scientists saying this for months. The following week he says he will end FEMA funding for testing, but is thankfully talked out of this.5. The Trump administration sends guidelines to governors saying they can re-open on May 1st. I don't think I need to say anything else about that. Trump also belittles states with stay-at-home orders. With the failures of testing, it is too late to contain the pandemic through contact tracing and individual quarantines alone. Universal quarantine became our only option for containment. Trump tweets something like ""liberate Michigan."" Trump supporters begin ignoring stay-at-home orders. By the end of the month, \~55,000 people are dead. Hospitals in New York were literally running out of body bags. You can find photos of the giant outdoor freezers they were dumping bodies in. This is unlike anything doctors have seen before, including H1N1, including bad flu seasons. ICUs are well over capacity. This is anecdotal (again, I think it makes a good point though), but we have heard the story of one doctor in NYC who had 3 patients dying and only 1 ventilator. Doctors are forced to choose who will live. Meanwhile, Trump says NYC does not need more ventilators. The Trump Administration does eventually provide sufficient ventilators (+1 for Trump), but again, what we needed came too late. Trump also falsely claims that the national stockpile was completely depleted. There were actually 19,000 ventilators in the stockpile but they were sent out too slowly.6. While this is all going on, several public officials who were criticizing Trump's response are fired and/or tweet-attacked by Trump. (Dr. Rick Bright and Christi Grimm off the top of my head).7. Trump is now claiming that the worsening of things in the U.S. is the Dems fault and is just passing off responsibility, even though Florida and Texas are currently doing terribly. Sorry for another anecdote, but I have a friend in Houston who says they're leaving some patients in the ER for 2+ days, and just putting others in hallways because there isn't enough room.8. Betsy DeVos and Trump push for the reopening of schools and businesses this past month, just as things are the absolute worst in this pandemic. Deaths have been trending up the past 5 days. Trump supporters are ignoring masking regulations, many saying the virus is a Democratic hoax. I realize that this isn't all TS and the videos I've seen are some of some of the whackiest people in the country **BUT** \-- I think this all goes to illustrate that the general rhetoric and visible complacency of Trump and his administration has altered public perception of this pandemic. People are not following guidelines, which is only making things worse, and I think Trump has 100% set the tone for people reacting this way.9. By the precautionary principle, all precautions should be left in place until we can be assured that hospitals have the capacity to handle future cases and that there is no longer the potential for harm to a significant proportion of society. Trump has pivoted to blaming Democrats for keeping things closed for worsening the economy and causing people to lose their jobs. An appropriate response to a deadly pandemic is not controversial to anyone in the scientific community. The economic consequences have been and will continue to be devastating. However, I think it's incorrect to blame Democrats for this. They are reacting appropriately to an established threat. Our country simply does not have the safety net infrastructure like Canada + the EU. I think that problem is a different issue, but also largely driven by Republican policy and rhetoric. Other countries had the social safety nets to pay their citizens to stay home. Those countries are now reopened, and are reopening *safely* because people are *listening to scientists*. There is anti-science rhetoric on both sides of the aisle for sure, but Trump's is killing Americans. Is he 100%, unequivocally responsible? No, there is no way a single person can be responsible for each and every death. Did he make things hundreds if not thousands of magnitudes worse? If we listened to scientists and physicians like other countries have, would we be in a much better spot? *Absolutely*.",,,1595188427,{},fyl736y,False,t3_htlen3,False,False,t1_fyl1632,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/htlen3/how_do_you_feel_about_the_white_house_blocking/fyl736y/,1595282650,5,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1595188427.0,1595190896.0,,

That being said, most hospitals are designed to run with ICU beds and otherwise at 80-90% capacity normally. So yes we gotta try to keep it below that magical line. But I think our best tool to do that is going to be raising the line not actually trying to lock down again. As bad as this thing is I think there are two important things to remember. First, our efforts to slow the spread with masks and distancing are very likely completely futile. Look at Wuhan in November, complete lockdown, masks etc. everyone still got it. Second our first attempt at slowing this thing likely caused more damage than it helped. From people loosing jobs, to business closing permanently, to suicide rates increasing over 1000% in the first month, to reports of child solicitation online and sex crimes doubling compared to last year, to people that died from not wanting to go to the hospital for not covid issues, and the list goes on. We have to look critically at both sides here. As far as other countries flattening the curve I don't agree there. For several reasons. First there is a serious argument to be made that many places in Europe are reaching or have reached herd immunity. It's a very complex question to answer and involves much more than flat percentages. Second, I'm gonna mention testing. Our testing has seriously spiked exponentially over the past few weeks which would explain why the deaths are not following the curve. The CDC director last week mentioned that based on our positive test rate coupled with some other factors indicates that we probably have at 10x the number of cases that are actually confirmed. Which would mean that this is not nearly as bad as we thought because so many people testing positive don't even know they have anything. Or they test positive for antibodies and they can trace it back to January and February before people knew it was here. Bottom line is, I do not believe locking down again or wearing masks is actually going to save anyone at all. I don't believe it did or will.

But I share a similar opinion. When SARS broke out in China back 2002, scientists were able to trace the spillover event. It turned out that the bats acted as reservoir hosts (where the virus lives long term) and then crossed over to cevits in the wet market. Everything seemed very transparent - scientists were able to test a ton of animals, tracing was done etc.But with Covid-19 everything is opaque and there are so many strange coincident.* Unlike in 2002 Chinese gov. is not allowing foreign scientists to study the disease locally. For SARS they know who Patient 0 was. The record (from 18 years ago) is very transparent. For Covid-19, none of that is known. If it is a simple spillover event, why hide all of that?* China has exactly 1 Level 4 biolab and it is located within walking distance of the initial epicenter in Wuhan. Based on news programs put out by the Chinese state media in 2017/2018, that biolab was studying potential SARS diseases. There is a news clip about a scientist who was going out to caves to collect bats to study novel corona viruses.* Northern Chinese cuisine (Wuhan) typically isn't as adventurous as Southern Chinese Cantonese cuisine. Exotic animals - and especially bats - are not common ingredients - there is no myth about health benefits associated with the animal. So it is strange that an wet market would be selling it there. (For example if the outbreak occurred in Guangdong, it would be a lot more believable.)* Then there are other just strange things: the genetic code for the virus was released back in December.  How did they get results so fast?Edit: I am not saying I knew it came from a lab. But the thing that really annoys me is that scientists just dismiss this possibility. Like ""we know it came from bats via the pangolin"". And I believe they can see the DNA markers on the virus, but I don't understand how they would know if it was a wetmarket accident or lab accident, from the virus alone....

I don't blame all of the people for this specific event.&gt;Is China to blame for the spread of the virus?Absolutely. They allowed citizens of Wuhan to travel internationally while banning their travel domestically. They allowed this when they started locking down Wuhan because of the virus and its spread.I'm aware of the way many Communist governments tend to work in terms of who they appoint to positions of power and influence. These tend to be inner party members who are appointed out of loyalty instead of merit. The inevitable result is ALWAYS a high level of incompetence.So, I posit the following:1. The Chinese government was researching and experimenting with a SARS virus. Whether it was an eventual bio-weapon or ""innocent"" research is unknown. Given the nature of the virus and the tinkering that can be seen with it, as well as the nature of the CCP and its goals, I'm inclined to believe the former.2. However, the release of the virus was likely due to simple incompetence. A faulty door seal. A researcher who failed to disinfect properly. A misplaced or mixed up vial/petri dish that exited the secure areas of the lab. Simple incompetence.3. Whether the release was purposeful or not, the CCP attempted to cover up the release of the virus to save face. A Communist government must always appear as if it were God (omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient). To admit failure is to admit fallibility, which shatters the illusion that the government is God. When you shatter that illusion, the subjugated ~~serfs~~ citizens see that the emperor has no clothes and the power the government wields is proven to be nothing but air.It is because of #3 that I place the responsibility for this crisis on China's government. It's because of #3 that I believe the country itself should be sanctioned into economic oblivion.Why? Because had they admitted something was wrong, many lives could have been saved. Because had they admitted they made a mistake, much of the Western World, while they would hold them to account for the mistake, wouldn't have outright condemned them. Instead, the West would have likely HELPED them contain the virus and protect their people. This is because the Western World values truth over face. When you tell the truth to the Western World, it tends to be far more forgiving and helpful.I say the Western World because most other civilizations value face over truth, and they would not be forgiving or helpful.

This is a good start and I've been following everything closely since the outbreak started in Wuhan.3.  As early as December 31, 2019, almost before anyone else, Taiwan's CDC actually started monitoring individuals coming in from the epicenter in Wuhan. And coincidently just a few days later on January 4, 2020 I myself was in Wuhan passing through and at the time it was just a mere [""Pneumonia-Like Illness""](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/asia/china-SARS-pneumonialike.html). By late January, they banned all travelers from Wuhan and then later all travel from Mainland China.4. Every Taiwanese citizen has a health card with a unique ID that all doctors and hospitals use to access online medical records. Providers use the card to document visits for reimbursement from the government. The government was then able to merge the health card database with information from immigration and customs to identify potential cases based on their travel history and clinical symptoms.&amp;#x200B;5. Around late January, the government banned all exports of face mask and then expecting the surge of demand and hoarding of them, rationed them by having citizens present their government health card where they were only allowed to buy on certain days and limited to the amount they could buy. Soldiers from the military were then mobilized to the factory floor to start ramping up production of face masks.&amp;#x200B;6. Taiwan took quarantines very seriously using phone tracking via GPS signals provided by telecoms operators to enforce mandatory quarantine. Police or local officials will then call the person quarantined everyday throughout the 14-day period to checkup on them. And a failure to answer the phone or if the reception is poor or the phone runs out of battery, could prompt a visit from the police trying to locate your whereabouts.As part of quarantining individuals receive a NT$1,000 ($33) daily stipend from the government as well as care packages of food and snacks with the intent to incentivize individuals to comply with quarantine and be truthful in declaring any symptoms.&amp;#x200B;Through all these steps the government has to international acclaim contain the virus while also largely having to avoid any type of economic or social shutdown. Now I do agree with you that if the US government would have tried to implement almost any one of these policies to the full degree that Taiwan did, there would have been strong pushback to the max at least legally or from people themselves.

Funny you ask questions in which aren't related to the way I feel how we should approach masks, which is leading by example. Smoking, which actually has decades of research and scientific medical proof of its side effects and just how harmful it is, is infringement of everyone's rights in enclosed areas. It literally violates ones personal space with smell and then cancer causing agents. I would maintain that smoking and masks are two entirely different things to compare against that are in no way a fair comparison or even similar in effect. Smoking indoors, depending on the establishment and local laws, is indeed still allowed although not in the same capacity as it use to be. I can name several businesses, here in the Houston area, that if you want to smoke indoors you are free to. Clothing, depending on local laws, is optional in many places around the world and even in many US states. In Oregon, clothing is pretty much optional as long as it is in a non sexual way. ""No shoes, no shirt, no service"" is a little thing that during the late 80's and throughout the 90's was something you'd see at every fast food restaurant and many other places. The fact is, that is not a law, but rather a business being allowed to choose who they serve. Businesses have that right. It is not a politicized issue either. It is simply that I business can choose to serve who they want. Masks should not be politicized. If a business wants to require a mask, it should be up to individual businesses as to whether or not their customers have to wear them inside. It should not be something that is regulated by law, it should not be mandated... it should be up to individual businesses as to how they want to operate their business model. I forget where it happened, I am inclined to believe it was Houston, but one bar wasn't allowing in or serving anyone that came wearing a mask. Masks were/are banned in that particular bar. That is perfectly acceptable as is the major retailors that won't let you in if you aren't wearing a mask. The whole issue on masks being politicized is absolutely silly and should be behind us by this point. Unfortunately as time goes on and our testing becomes more readily available and better at identifying positive Wuhan cases... more people are absolutely going to show positive for it. It is not that they were recently infected being the reason for the rise in numbers, only that we can now identify it. I'd be surprised if Wuhan infections were less than 80% of the population. I am a firm believer that the way it spreads, how social we are as a people and the lack of hygiene in America, and most of the world for that matter, it seems more likely most people have antibodies and/or already had it. There is no sense in pushing masks whether by law or force as it infringes on personal rights and individuals worried about it are still free to protect themselves. As to the other user orbit, seat belts really should be optional. They infringe personal rights. That said, I understand they save lives. They also save horrific messes from happening. Though, having a accident with an 18 wheeler while in a tiny car can also produce as bad or worse results as someone not wearing a seatbelt. Seatbelts were never mandated until late 90's early 2000's, but the inclusion of seatbelts in all vehicles made it easy to push laws into mandating their use. There are plenty of older cars that never had seatbelts and aren't required by law to be worn in those cars like the old VW bugs or the Thing.

Unsurprisingly, COVID is alive and well in America today. Regardless, the calls of “racism” were a combination of (1) Trump blacklisting China but not other countries known to have active infections, and (2) Trump promoting the “Wuhan Virus” as a crude (and racially charged) alternative name to what was officially known as COVID19. AFAIK no one called Trump a racist for preventing people with COVID from entering the states; they called him a racist for inserting unnecessary, racially and politically motivated messaging into an otherwise apolitical response to a pandemic (do you have examples of the former? Would be interested in knowing what convinced you that was the case).

I think, that given by the fact I didn't say these songs should be taken down that I am okay with both people saying those things and that the crowd was fine with it.&gt;Do you see how the actions of these people at this rally would make people on the left concerned and make an impression in their minds that people on the right are part of a movement that they could never get behind? To me that's an extremely weird and open ended question that doesn't really have a solid answer. So I responded in 2 parts. First was that plenty of people can't get behind BLM. Second was that the left should address their own issues before worrying about the right. Reasons for this are, yes I can see why they may be concerned. But that doesn't mean I think they are validated in feeling that way. And that if they do hold those opinions they should first reflect upon their own groups before holding others to higher standards.&gt;Can you give examples where these songs that are so terrible are sung at political rallies for the left? Or are you just pointing out that it wasn’t the worst song they could have sung? I never stated that terrible songs were sung at left political rallies so by design the question is flawed. But I still gave an example of a chant that has violent connotations. I did answer the second question, just left out the 'no'.&gt;Do you understand that your silence says something? I answered Yes.&gt;So you never criticize anything anyone on the left says? I probably should've answered a bit clearer. I think you did know what I meant by your future comments but what I meant was ""Do I criticise? Yes. Do I condemn/denounce? Generally not.""&gt;You won’t critique people talking about chopping up bodies like the Saudi’s do? I answered that I have a right to critique how I want. I suppose you could say I'm 'avoiding' the question here but I think it's pretty clear cut, because I haven't critiqued it.&gt;Why not just give your assessment of what the people at the rally said (or sang along to)? I don't have an assessment. I don't care what they said. But I'll bite. I don't really like the idea of politically motivated violence. And if we are to take the song that some of the crowd sung at complete face value, then yes I think that it's terrible they sung that.

Personal responsibility has a place. Most of the time I see Brett Kavanaugh's name on reddit, the word rapist follows. AFAIK there has been no evidence for it. Should these people all be sued for defamation? Should they be held to the same account someone who actually made a false rape allegation (and no I'm not saying Blasey made a false claim)? To me no they shouldn't, they have no need to prove anything or hold any real responsibility. It's a social media platform on the internet. Context matters.

Do you think there is a soul in the states who doesn't know that?  Since we all know where it originated, what do you think Trump's reason is to continually say Kung fu/Wuhan?

Why does it matter if the first outbreak was in China?  The Spanish Flu was started in America, but America did not declare it the American flu.  Should we start?  The American flu which killed over one hundred million people in 1918.  The American Flu killed my great uncle in 1918.  The Americans were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people. Your American Flu killed 55 thousand Canadian lives.  Did you guys take responsibility?   Please don't get me wrong, I don't blame Americans, it would be silly to and it wouldn't help to get the virus under control.

One hundred and thirty thousand Americans are dead.  If you guys don't get a handle on it, and it looks like you probably won't, it will mean hundreds of thousand more Americans will die.

I would link a corresponding EO, however this was done without one.In late 2019, all we knew with any certainty was that we were told it was like the flu (which turned out to be not that far off base in terms of the statistics).  At the outset in the US, the government was not so much downplaying it, as trying to prevent panic and falling morale.  There is no reason why you can't simultaneously say that something isn't a major threat but should also be taken seriously (for the record, this is what we do with the flu).  At the time, we couldn't have known whether it would blow over or not, and I don't know about you, but I'd rather my leaders silently prepare to prevent a catastrophe while attempting to maintain morale among the people - which is what Trump was doing at the outset, and is what I would do if I were a manager of any kind.

I'll give you that it could be better, but we are still testing more per capita with a lower per capita confirmed case count than Spain (who took an approach similar to Italy), and we have almost double the cases per capita of Sweden (who never locked down).

Health care is a human rightI agree to a point. I believe that healthcare should be available for everyone, and I honestly like Trumps original ideas of allowing cross-state insurance purchases and having medical facilities post their prices so people could shop around. I think that would reign in a lit of the over-procong without putting us in the position the NHS is where they are under staffed, under paid, out of budget and have extremely long wait times. They also don't cover a lot of mental health services and things they consider non-essential.&gt;2. Campaign Finance and Electoral ReformThis I agree with, but is never going to happen, no matter who was the Dem nominee. I also want term limits in the House and Senate.  &gt;3. End the warsNever goona happen, and we need to be militarily ready. Under Obama the military was so strapped for cash they had to salvage parts. Not okay. The best offense is a prepared defense. We have at least 4 or 5 countries that I can name off the top of my head that want to kill us as soon as they see an opening, and we have counteies who depend on us to help them. The military is not just about wars, they provide medical services, jobs to locals, food, and support local economies.&gt;4. Fighting the climate crisisI believe the best way to do this is to encourage big businesses to participate, not punish them for growing larger. Offer tax incentives for bringing jobs back to the US (thus reducing shipping), for green energy, etc. Offer tax incentives to car companies who can make the most fuel efficient car, etc.&gt;5. Wealth inequalityI have not heard a single viable idea to fix this.  First, many homeless people don't want help, they want to get free things and live the way they want.  Universal Basic Income: will increase the cost of living across-the-board negating the increase and will assist people who have addictions and compulsions in getting money to feed their habits. The best thing that could be done would be a tax break for middle class, and giving tax incentives for companies to raise their minimum wages.  Then, stem the flow of illegal immigrants so they can't take advantage of their low wages.&gt;6. Free collegeThis is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. ""Free college"" would not be free, because our taxes would go up even more than they are now, making that degree useless.  It's not free when other people are paying for it, and I'm sure you'd be all for it until it starts coming out of your paycheck.  You want free college? Join the military for 4 years. &gt;7. Proper response to coronavirus-Trump stopped travel from China, and was listening to the WHO who said there was no danger.-the vaccine and tests were stalled because we couldn't get samples from China-we have strict regulations in regards to treatments and testing.-Trump has/had some of the best people (thinking Fauci and Berk) on this, and we have had far less deaths than they thought. Our supply chains were/are way to dependent on China, Trump did a great job and Biden wouldn't have done any better. In fact, they way he responded to Trumps travel ban makes me think that even more people would have died. Were there mistakes? Yes. Maybe Cuomo shouldn't have mandated nursing homes take in positive patients, maybe the WHO should have been more on it. Maybe we should have insisted on assisting in Wuhan.

Study size could be larger.We don't have the big randomized study results in yet (they are underway), to my knowledge. But if we want a higher *n* we can do observational data analysis on large numbers of people, such as what was done here and published in The Lancet today: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext&gt;96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273–1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation.To help interpret some of these numbers at the bottom there, let's take the example of:&gt;18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457The first number is the absolute percent of the patients in that group (in this case the HCQ only group) that experienced a certain adverse event, simple enough. A *hazard ratio* is the ratio compared to 1 in the control group of a particular adverse event (in this particular instance the event is death) occuring, so a hazard ratio of 1.335 means a 1.335:1 ratio of the adverse event occuring in the treatment group vs control group. But the hazard ratio is given as an average value, and actually has a range of potential error, so to address the range of error they then say 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.223-1.457. That means there is a 95% chance that the *actual hazard ratio* lies between 1.223 and 1.457. A measured hazard ratio is considered *statistically significant* if that 95% confidence interval range does not include or cross over 1. So for example if they had given a hazard ratio of 1.2 and a confidence interval of 0.9-1.5, that's not significant, because there is over a 5% chance that the *real* hazard ratio is 1:1 (no difference) or less than 1 (the intervention is safer than control group).And admittedly this isn't randomized, but what I do see here that makes this paper good is: Big n, statistically significant hazard ratios in ALL CQ/HCQ treatment groups across the board, and doing things like ""controlling for multiple confounding factors"" in the data analysis, which is what many other papers have not done, such as a multitude of smaller non-randomized studies that essentially said ""sicker people got HCQ and sicker people were more likely to die or have other problems"". This paper controls for that via data analysis on multiple levels, and that's exactly what I would be looking for in a paper like this one.Overall, the only paper done with COVID patients suggesting a benefit was that first one done in Wuhan, which was small in scope and has *not been replicated*, whereas the ""no clear benefit, definite increased risk"" result *has been replicated* across multiple studies, even if all those studies don't employ the best methods.It's not perfect info (such is unfortunately true in much of medicine) but it's certainly not ""nonsenese"", what are your thoughts?",,,1590180945,{},frhjdmk,False,t3_gnl4a0,False,True,t1_frhgjl8,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/gnl4a0/do_you_plan_to_take_hydroxychloroquine/frhjdmk/,1590185781,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1590180945.0,1590183415.0,,

To be a non-politician politician and shake up the establishment. However, half the country wanted an establishment president and voted for one, the system is still set up around the expectation of such a person taking the office, and the media still expects such a person to stand before them to answer their questions. I'm not disagreeing with this.  They do expect the status quo, and that's why it's funny to watch the fireworks they fundamentally dont get that trump was elected in part to spit in their face.  What do they expect?&gt;Yes, to Trump it may be tiring and annoying that they keep expecting him to speak clearly and eloquently about complex political issues and concrete policy, but to everyone else that’s just what the job of president entails. He doesn’t want to do the job his way, but can he fault everyone else for wanting him to anyway?No but I also dont think it's his job to become what they want either.&gt;It really doesn’t matter who it is or which party their from, anyone who did the job the way Trump has been doing the job and behaving like him would have gotten then exact same response. He’s shaking up the entire thing, and what, he expects there to not be criticism? A man like him should not only expect that response, but welcome it and use it to get his new message across. How is he supposed to get a message across when prominent new outlets are wilfully misrepresenting what is going on in the administration.  Just this weekend chuck Todd's meet the press edited a response from william Barr in an attempt to make it look like he was saying the exact opposite of what he actually said.&gt;People here talk about these journalists as “enemies” and “hostile” and “nasty” and “fighting” with the president. They’re just asking him questions! The same questions any half-competent President should expect to be able to answer. It’s not their fault he doesn’t want to do the job the way the job is historically supposed to be done. When they ask follow-ups and claw for answers after a Trump made some bizarre claim or absurd statement, that’s them doing their job: trying to get clear, understandable answers. They're not ""just question""  and they're not doing their job.  The performance artist like jim acosta playing a role for ratings and trying to get their face on the news in a heated exchange so they can sell books.  They're not interested in getting an answer they're interested in making a buck.&gt;Can you give me real, concrete examples of journalists being hostile during a press briefing, and can you honestly tell me conservative news journalists didn’t behave exactly the same during Obama’s years?I dont care if they did it under obama I dont care for conservative outlets either.  I really hope read media does and people who want the truth instead of eating take their place.

Italy: Jan 31st (Still hours ahead of Trump): Italy suspends all flights to and from China (more comprehensive than Trump's response)  New Zealand:Jan 28th: NZ's ministry of health set up a National Health Coordination Center to help mitigate the spread by tracking contacts. 3 full days before it was even declared by the WHO as an international risk.   So obviously not the first, even disregarding China's actions.  Let's move on to the CDC.   Jan 7th: Establish a Covid-19 incident management teamJan 17th: Began screening at 3 international airports to passengers who had traveled to Wuhan, but obviously even this was too late as it had spread. Jan 21st: Activated Emergency Operations Center (to again help plan and mitigate). As we know their work was largely ignored by Trump.Jan 27th: Began working with the White House Corona virus Task Force.  Lastly; I'm a little curious what you think the Governors were supposed to have done? They do not have federal agencies under their control and, given that this was a NATIONAL issue that spanned the entire country in a matter of days, I'm struggling to think what they actually COULD have done before January 31st. Any ideas?   So it's definitely not like Trump didn't have forewarning about all this stuff.

Before we begin let me ask you a question. What is the point of the shut down and social distancing? Is it to make sure no one gets Covid ever? Or is it to space out the infection rate so that hospitals dont get overwhelmed?The left and thier media allies have moved the goal posts massively here from spacing out infections to no one should get covid ever which is the thrust of your questions. If we were to have it your way the country would never go back to work but in reality we all know that should Biden win you will change your tune the day after the election. In reality even the hero of the Democrats for this story Cuomo has tacitly declared that the NY health system is not overwhelmed.1) he has sent away the hospital ship2) he hasnt even used the extra makeshift hospital spaces3) he has furloughed medical personel because they have nothing to do4) He has allowed elective surgeries again, because again, the hospitals have nothing to do.5) He hasnt even mentioned his 40000 ventilator demand recently because he knew it was bogus and Trump called him out on it. (note that even without his 40000 ventilators no one in New York who needed a ventilator went without one)To the NYkers out there I ask you guys, what are you in total lockdown for? Why not open up a little bit so that more people get treated in the hospital (without overwhelming them) and have more people get immunity and at least some economic activity? This is the exact same thing with the meat processing plants and liability. No one can guarantee a covid free environment ever. Even if you were to wear a mask there would still be some minute chance of passing it on. Hell you have the studies in NY and LA county showing that even with draconian lockdowns they had hundreds of thousands of people with the covid antibody.BTW if you truly believed your not one person should get covid moral stance you should be pressing Cuomo to shut down the subways and impose a Wuhan like lockdown in NY. But you dont. You just want to keep the misery going as long as possible for political purposes even when the stated goal of the lockdown, spacing out infections to prevent overwhelming the hospitals, has been met.

The agency noted the overall risk to Canadians was low and there were no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada. The CBSA said it would not be, at that time, implementing extra screening measures, but would “monitor the situation closely”.&gt;On March 11, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced a $1 billion response fund, including $500 million to go to provinces and territories, a $50 million contribution to the World Health Organization and an additional $275 million to fund COVID-19 research in Canada. Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages Mélanie Joly stated that she had been discussing means of mitigating the outbreak’s impact on the air travel industry.&gt;On April 6, Trudeau introduced extra aid for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), saying “there are groups of people who aren’t benefiting from [it] who probably should.”On April 9, the federal government released modelling that, even with strong public health measures, showed between 11,000 and 22,000 deaths over the course of the pandemic, with that number being closer to 300,000 deaths if no measures had been taken. Trudeau stated that “normality as it was before will not come back full-on until we get a vaccine for this”, and that residents would “have to remain vigilant for at least a year.”&gt;On April 10, the RCMP disclosed it has been asked to enforce the Quarantine Act. Penalties for violations can include a fine of up to $750,000 and imprisonment for six months. One reporter said that the RCMP “could enter homes to enforce Quarantine Act orders if Canadians don’t self-isolate... [and] will do physical checks to enforce it.” It was reported that the Canadian Forces Intelligence Command Medical Intelligence Cell (MEDINT) has submitted reports on the outbreak in Wuhan since January 2020. On April 15, Trudeau warned against premature reopening of the economy, stating that “in order to get to that point, we need to continue doing what we are doing now for many more weeks”.&gt;The federal government’s pandemic response is based on two primary documents: the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness planning guidelines, which outlines risks and measures to address a viral disease, and the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Public Health Response Plan for Biological Events, which includes identifying, tracking, and ensuring rapid access to medical care. As of February 27, the response plan was at level 3 (escalated).&gt;On March 18, the federal government announced an $82-billion response package with a variety of measures. On March 25, the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act received royal assent from Governor General Julie Payette. The measures in this first package included:* Canada Child Benefit (CCB): Payments for the 2019–20 year were increased by $300 per child.* Goods and Services Tax (GST) credit: The maximum annual GST credit payment amount for the 2019–20 year was doubled.* Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB): This new benefit provided a taxable benefit of $2,000 a month for up to four months for those who had lost their job, were sick, quarantined, or taking care of someone sick with COVID-19, as well as working parents staying home to take care of their kids.* Canada Student Loans: A six-month moratorium was placed on repayment.* Temporary business wage subsidy: Eligible small employers received a three-month 10 percent wage subsidy.* Tax flexibility: The income tax filing deadline was also extended from April 30, 2020 to June 1, 2020. Tax payments were deferred to September 2020.The CERB launched on April 6, and within one week, nearly 3.5 million Canadians applied for this benefit; this grew to 7.12 million by April 24. On April 15, Trudeau announced that the CERB would be extended to workers making up to $1,000 per month, and that the government planned to work with the provinces to implement salary top-ups for essential workers who make less than $2,500 per month.&gt;	On March 20, the government announced a plan to ramp up production of medical equipment, switching assembly lines to produce ventilators, masks and other personal protective gear. Companies will be able to access funds through the government’s Strategic Innovation Fund.[Compared with the United States:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_the_United_States)&gt;The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on January 31, then on February 2 implemented a ban of most foreign nationals who had recently traveled to China. The initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, or testing for the virus. A lack of mass testing obscured the true extent of the outbreak. In February, manufacturing defects rendered many government-developed test kits unusable, commercial tests were disallowed by regulations, and strict testing requirements were in place. The U.S. tested fewer than 10,000 people by March 11. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump was optimistic, dismissing the threat posed by coronavirus and claiming the outbreak was under control. February 25 was the first time that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned the American public to prepare for a local outbreak.By early March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began allowing public health agencies and private companies to develop and administer tests, and loosened requirements to allow anyone with a doctor’s order to be tested. By the end of the month, over 1 million people had been tested (1 per 320 inhabitants). The Trump administration largely waited until mid-March to start purchasing large quantities of medical equipment. In late March, the administration started to use the Defense Production Act to direct industries to produce medical equipment. Federal health inspectors surveyed hospitals in late March, reporting shortages of test supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other resources due to extended patient stays while awaiting test results.",,,1588067242,{},fotv5af,False,t3_g8u6cr,False,True,t1_forgeyp,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/g8u6cr/how_would_you_feel_if_at_trumps_next_briefing_he/fotv5af/,1588067243,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1588067242.0,,,

Hong Kong didn't have a confirmed case until January 23. Not sure how you can conclude they were ""fucked 4 ways"" with only 12 cases and 0 deaths for the month of January. And sidenote, the border was never fully closed with mainland China. Yes the President has access to a lot of intelligence. But ask yourself what the intelligence was. He was probably told there was a strange virus on the other side of the world. I'm not sure what you expected him to do. It was literally on the other side of the world. And thanks to China we had no idea how bad it was until it was already on us. The left gave him shit for banning travel to China. They would have lost their minds if he did something before we even had a confirmed case. There's lots of diseases all over the world. We don't stop what we're doing and brace for impact every time a disease pops up somewhere. Yes this turned out to be different but there was no way to know until it was too late. And to clarify ""It’s not like he knew this was as bad as it was”, correct me if I'm wrong but you seem to be assuming he was aware that the Wuhan virus was catastrophic in December or eaely January and then kept it a secret or downplayed it or something. This is utterly ridiculous. The left likes to portrary him as an idiot then say shit like this. How could he possibly keep information like this a secret? Do you honestly believe he masterfully convinced every person who heard the briefings in December and January to stay quiet about some bombshell, mystery information? What would even be the point?

So who was saying more should be done and when did they say it? Because the Dems' two Presidential front runners and a decent chunk of left-leaning media thought Trump was doing TOO MUCH as of January 31st. Trump is not out to kill Americans. It's not like he knew this was as bad as it was and then kept it a secret because he loves when people dying from disease. China fucked us hard on this one.

It has been stressed by healthcare professionals from the beginning that mass testing is hugely important. The US still lags behind South Korea in terms of per capita testing. WHO sent 250,000 tests around the world in February. The US did not request any of these tests, deciding to opt for its own design - which has shown to have much poorer results in terms of accuracy. - Trump needs to begin laying the groundwork for a second spike and possibly another lockdown after this one has been lifted. We are more than a year away from a vaccine, at best, and we are still lacking a clear idea of what the long term plan is given the information we have at the moment. - Trump should have been stronger on China. The travel ban was the right call in the face of partisan criticism. But it should have come along much tougher measures to get a team on the ground to monitor the situation in Wuhan first hand. Trump was parroting Chinese propaganda lines that the situation was being handled well, when he should have been much more sceptical. Pulling funding from the WHO just allows China to move in with more leverage (it's also important to remember that WHO cannot order member countries to take a course of action - they advice and support.) - He could pass or push for legislation that provides greater sick pay provisions. He needs to look at the knock on effects of rolling lockdowns across the country and begin to address these. - In regards to communication, a big part of addressing this diseases is ensuring the public understands the risks and getting them to act accordingly. I think Trump has widely missed the mark on this point. Good communication has the potential to be not a minor part of a large battle, but a large part of the large battle. I'm thinking of the way FDR used his 'fire side chats' to influence the publics behaviour in line with policy put in place to address the banking crisis. We're seeing people gather, in mass, without proper PPE, without practising social distancing, in order to make the point they know how best to protect themselves from the disease. Trump needs to make it clear he understands their concerns (which I think he has) - but make it clear they are indangering themselves and the people they will come into contact with, and he needs to make it easier for people to access PPE equipment.",,,1587913948,{},fon7k1q,False,t3_g7axq8,False,True,t1_fomy32x,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/g7axq8/how_are_current_supporters_processing_trumps/fon7k1q/,1587913950,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1587913948.0,,,

Unless they're willing to continue living under some form of totalitarianism indefinitely, do you think they'll avoid significant outbreaks later on?It's far easier to avoid an outbreak if you can adequately isolate and contact-trace a limited number of cases.

China as a superpower would certainly not accept any kind of help similar to the response given with Ebola, as that would reflect poorly on CCP domestically.That's a possibility, but it's difficult thing to speculate. Would China see it as a threat from the US under Trump vs Obama? I would argue under Obama there is a much higher chance of China being ok with allowing doctors and other healthcare workers to help stem the crisis, especially if the US is paying for some of it. Probably no military aid would be allowed, which would be different than with Ebola, but other aid I think has a shot of being accepted.&gt;So with no options for sending in teams we would have poor understanding of how covid19 behaves early on. That also limits preemptively measurements to things like shutting down travel to and from China, followed up with recommended quarantine periods for people returning from international destinations. Let's assume for a second China didn't allow anyone to help under Obama. Does that mean the rest of what happened follows? No, I would say it's unlikely. For starters, Obama's administration would have very likely taken the spread seriously from the start. They may not have imposed travel restrictions on China as early as Trump tbh, but I'm fairly certain they would have requested quarantine measures and testing capabilities be spun up on every possible source. Since that is what they did for Ebola. Moreover, helping in China might not have been an option, but helping in Italy and South Korea and Iran could have definitely been possible. Remember, those were the next hotspots for the virus spread. Even just Obama drawing significant attention to the crisis early on could have controlled the spread, pressuring states to do whatever they could to limit the disease count. Just look at South Korea for how this could have been handled. They have barely 10,000 cases, and they had their first known case the same day as the US. Do you really think for a second the US under Obama wouldn't have acted the same way as South Korea? Because that just seems like pessimistic thinking to be pessimistic. That administration had plans upon plans to deal with such a threat, and went through mock scenarios to try to figure out how best to stop such a crisis. And they even briefed the incoming Trump administration on the whole process. So clearly they thought it was a very high priority. Trump in turn, from the sound of it, took all that work, saw it had ""Obama"" written on it, and threw it in the trash. He removed the pandemic response people from the National Security Council, tried multiple times to defund the CDC, gutted basically every person within his government who could have warned him about this or convinced him to take it seriously, and then denied the problem was even a problem for over a month. His response just has been catastrophically bad in my mind, and has lead to thousands of needless deaths. &gt;The density difference in place where it stroke would certainly also add a greater infection rate, allowing for unknown carriers bringing it out of the country. Density isn't actually that much different between Wuhan and the West African cities Ebola was in. Sierra Leone's capital Freetown, where the first cases began to spread, has a [population density of 1,224 people per square kilometer](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/sierra-leone-population/), whereas the city Wuhan has a [population density of about 1,200 people per square kilometer](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/wuhan-population/). Conakry, Guinea's capital and the location of the first phase of the outbreak, has a [much higher population density at 10,500 inhabitants per square kilometer](https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital-facts-for-conakry-guinea/). Monrovia in Liberia has [a bit lower population density at 7,400 ppsk](https://www.worldscapitalcities.com/capital-facts-for-monrovia-liberia/), but is still several times higher than Wuhan. All three of these cities were the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, so it's not correct to say that population density is dramatically different in Wuhan, China than these African cities. And likely their healthcare infrastructure is less robust than in China, so that means treatment and education on the virus might have lead to even higher infection rates, not lower ones.  &gt;This is not an endorsement of Trumps response, that I agree have been unsatisfying , but I don't see Obama or any other president avoiding it getting to the US and spreading. Again, I'd like to point to countries that have taken this virus seriously from the start and down a great job of containing it; South Korea, Iceland, Taiwan, Japan, Canada. They all have significantly lower rates of infection. This outcome for the US was not inevitable.&gt;Likely could have been contained better, allowing for less strict conditions now, but avoided completely seems unrealistic to me. You obviously don't have to agree, as this is just alternative history speculation, but I hope you will at least agree that the comparison between the two diseases are not just a 1:1?The diseases are different, as I've already acknowledged, but the response effort from a different president would not be the same either. Again, estimates showed there were going to be over 1 million Ebola cases in less than a year from the start of the outbreak if people didn't act quickly. It was already spreading to major countries, as there were infected cases in Nigeria, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the US. They were very small numbers because they were very well contained, but still they did happen. I think the biggest difference is that for coronavirus, people seem to be able to spread the disease asymptomatically, which I don't think is the case with Ebola. But that doesn't mean the disease can't spread by plane or other travel. As I said in another post, the rate of infection was comparable to the Spanish Flu, which obviously ripped through the global population.

We didnt have the option of sending Doctors into China. They hid things to to try to mitigate public scrutiny and avoided american access. Check that stat sheet and you will see  that we DID offer to send professionals to China. Also Ebola doesnt compare to the chinese virus. They dont compare on transmission or spread. We were lucky that ebola didnt tranmit well and was in a place where little travel occurs. China is the opposite of that. There is high travel and the virus is easily transmissible. Bill gates covers this in his ted talk from a few years back on how the world was really lucky that ebola wasnt more dangerious and it had little to do with the US containing it.     &gt; Ebola was estimated to infect over 1 million people in less than a year.

I have no idea if there's a legal premise for doing so, and I'm not an expert in international law, so I can't comment on that. I firmy believe, however, the rest of the world should be radically reassessing its investiture in China's economy. Japan and some US firms are, I have heard/read, doing this already. Japan set aside billions to pay off whoever has production facilites in China to get out, and some US companies are doing the same. I could go on about the Muslim prison camps that act as effective slave pens. I could talk about the awful conditions people live and work in. I could talk about how the vast swathe of China's technological advances are either stolen or reverse-engineered from the West. I could talk about them trying to recruit our trained professionals on the sly, buy out our politicians, and their infiltration of our universities. All of these would be valid reasons to start putting and end to, or severely limiting, our working relationship witb China, and how the rest of the world ought to do likewise.

I'll only mention this so you know we're on the same page here but it's like the BS about Trump retweeting the fire Fauci thing. Yes, he was retweeting it to call it fake news and then actual fake news commenced. While retweeting does promote a tweet, his intention was not support. I understand that it was spin.What's interesting is that you don't see it here when it supports Trump's stance, but is just as glaringly spun. It's from the TW media, so it's not surprising it's spun the way it is.It has the letter verbatim.&gt;""News resources today indicate that at least seven atypical pneumonia cases were reported in Wuhan, CHINA. Their health authorities replied to the media that the cases were believed not SARS; however the samples are still under examination, and cases have been isolated for treatment. I would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us. Thank you very much in advance for your attention to this matter.""That really is all they said. That is what they are saying is their warning ""that the novel coronavirus may be transmitted from human to human"" they sent to the WHO. Here's their reasoning:&gt;Chen, who is also head of Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), argued that while Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control did not actually mention ""human-to-human"" transmissions in the email, it had ""strongly hinted"" at the possibility.  &gt;  &gt;He said the letter clearly indicated that health authorities in China confirmed seven patients with atypical pneumonia had been isolated for treatment.  &gt;  &gt;""If being isolated for treatment is not a warning, what situation will constitute a warning?"" Chen said.These were at risk pneumonia patients with an unknown disease at the time that, while they didn't think it was SARs, had severe symptoms and as they could not be sure there was still a possibility it was SARs. Isolating them is an obvious and critical thing to do when you have a serious disease you do not yet understand. Of course there's a risk. If you don't know what something is, you don't know what it can do. That's why they were isolated.Even if there was any level of warning in there, their letter is telling the WHO what they saw on the global news, news that China had warned the WHO about the virus. They are, in fact, saying they don't know anything apart from what they saw in the news and were requesting more information. Even if they had given a warning, they knew nothing about it.Now I will say that a responsible thing for the WHO to do is to share any and all health data with everyone regardless. I thinks it's terrible that data which costs nothing to share and saves lives isn't made readily available, especially if that data could inform people better and make better decisions in a pandemic. I understand not sharing physical wares or providing services to them that cost money if they aren't contributing financially, but sharing data you collected anyways for your own purposes that could help save lives is a no brainer.Now that you have read their letter, I can't imagine you still feel they did warn the WHO of human to human transmission as they claim. If you do, I would love to understand the thinking that go you there.The other part with the tweet, it said ""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel."" They were relaying what China was telling them.I haven't seen actual proof that China knew differently and was lying, though I can see the argument as we do know some information has been covered up, but on this one it was only 3 days after the first death and they only had a few hundred cases.It is entirely possible and reasonable at that point to believe that they hadn't seen any evidence, and in fact, since many people are asymptomatic observation would show that many people around the patients appear to not contract it, and those that do don't show symptoms for 4 to 14 days until after exposure, so not only do you not have evidence of human to human transmission, you have evidence to the contrary.That tweet was detrimental and caused a huge lapse in using appropriate PPE and earlier social distancing, but it's reasonable to assume that not only was the WHO just relaying findings but that China wasn't lying in that specific report they gave to them. It was a bad decision in retrospect, but perfectly reasonable to think it was the most accurate information at the time.I do want to point out that both the WHO and China corrected this within a week and by the 22nd of January were advising social distancing worldwide. They provided the new data and at that point we finally knew the true numbers.Trump, on the other hand, who had all of this same information, waited until March 16th to stop telling people is wasn't a big deal and was going just go away. The world had about 500 known cases with about 20 confirmed deaths when China went on lockdown on January 23rd.

I wasn’t aware it was the one I was actually more familiar with and has been on the news cycle for a while now. The reality is, the majority of what’s contained within that report is corroborated by an “unnamed source.” Without the actual report in hand, there’s very little to say about what the contents of said report were. Again, I’ve seen this cycled multiple times and the whole argument boils down to “this guy says that Trump received a report saying this could end up being a problem.” That means very little relative to the present situation, to be short with it. Again, hundreds of intelligence reports are produced weekly addressing a wide breadth of possible threats to America - unfortunately, one report in a laundry list of information generated means effectively nothing. Should they’ve taken it more seriously - across the board? Yes, apparently, considering the state the global community is in. But that’s a classic example of hindsight bias - nobody would close a country entirely based on information regarding a *possible* disease that may impact US Military operations. Also, your comment assumes that nothing was done in light of this report - which is just objectively false. Here is a list of actions taken by this administration since the outbreak started in China during Jan and Feb (this was generated by the White House so obviously take it with a grain of salt, but it all corroborates with what they’ve actually done thus far): *December 31: China reports the discovery of the coronavirus to the World Health Organization.January 3: CDC Director Robert Redfield sent an email to the director of the Chinese CDC, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus.January 5: CDC Director Redfield sent another email to the Chinese CDC Director, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak,January 6: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice for Wuhan, China due to the spreading coronavirus.January 7: The CDC established a coronavirus incident management system to better share and respond to information about the virus.January 11: The CDC issued a Level I travel health notice for Wuhan, China.January 17: The CDC began implementing public health entry screening at the 3 U.S. airports that received the most travelers from Wuhan – San Francisco, New York JFK, and Los Angeles.January 20: Dr. Fauci announces the National Institutes of Health is already working on the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus.January 21: The CDC activated its emergency operations center to provide ongoing support to the coronavirus response.January 23: The CDC sought a “special emergency authorization” from the FDA to allow states to use its newly developed coronavirus test.January 27: President Trump tweeted that he made an offer to President Xi Jinping to send experts to China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak.January 27: The CDC issued a level III travel health notice urging Americans to avoid all nonessential travel to China due to the coronavirus.January 27: The White House Coronavirus Task Force started meeting to help monitor and contain the spread of the virus and provide updates to the President. January 29: The White House announced the formation of the Coronavirus Task Force to help monitor and contain the spread of the virus and provide updates to the President. January 31: The Trump Administration:Declared the coronavirus a public health emergency. Announced Chinese travel restrictions. Suspended entry into the United States for foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmitting the coronavirus.January 31: The Department of Homeland Security took critical steps to funnel all flights from China into just 7 domestic U.S. airports.February 3: The CDC had a team ready to travel to China to obtain critical information on the novel coronavirus, but were in the U.S. awaiting permission to enter by the Chinese government.February 2: The CDC expanded enhanced entry screening to eight major airports across the nation.February 4: President Trump vowed in his State of the Union Address to “take all necessary steps” to protect Americans from the coronavirus.February 5: The Trump Administration and health officials briefed lawmakers on the Federal Government's coronavirus response efforts.February 6: The CDC began shipping CDC-Developed test kits for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus to U.S. and international labs.February 7: President Trump told reporters that the CDC is working with China on the coronavirus. February 9: The White House Coronavirus Task Force briefed governors from across the nation at the National Governors’ Association Meeting in Washington.February 11: The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expanded a partnership with Janssen Research &amp; Development to “expedite the development” of a coronavirus vaccine.February 12: The U.S. shipped test kits for the 2019 novel coronavirus to approximately 30 countries who lacked the necessary reagents and other materials.February 12: The CDC was prepared to travel to China but had yet to receive permission from the Chinese government.February 14: The CDC began working with five labs to conduct “community-based influenza surveillance” to study and detect the spread of coronavirus.February 18: HHS announced it would engage with Sanofi Pasteur in an effort to quickly develop a coronavirus vaccine and to develop treatment for coronavirus infections.February 22: A WHO team of international experts arrives in Wuhan, China.February 24: The Trump Administration sent a letter to Congress requesting at least $2.5 billion to help combat the spread of the coronavirus.Febraury 25: HHS Secretary Azar testified before the Senate HELP committee on the Administration's coronavirus response efforts.February 26: President Trump discussed coronavirus containment efforts with Indian PM Modi and updated the press on his Administration’s containment efforts in the U.S. during his state visit to India.February 29: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed certified labs to develop and begin testing coronavirus testing kits while reviewing pending applications.February 29: The Trump Administration:- Announced a level 4 travel advisory to areas of Italy and South Korea. - Barred all travel to Iran. - Barred the entry of foreign citizens who visited Iran in the last 14 days.*Keep in mind as you read that - the first case arrived in the US from China on Dec 31st - the day China reported the disease. Your “Wingdings” example is completely irrelevant to this discussion and I have no comment on it. If your example included silencing people trying to speak out against your Wingdings, collaborating (or at the bare minimum, successfully misleading) with independent bodies to hide your defects, and actively running a massive multi-billion dollar coverup and misinformation campaign, it’d maybe fit a bit better. But as you’ve presented it, you’ve been intentionally obtuse and it is not applicable. &gt; And why do you assume every country had access to the same evidence as America? America doesn't share it's intelligence with every nation, and we certainly can't guarantee that America shared any specific piece of intelligence.Nobody said that.&gt; And again, are you okay with make America great again meaning make America fifteenth place again?I’d drop that if I were you.

Once again, I’d like to thank Dr Didier Houssin, who has done a superb job of leading the Emergency Committee through what was a very complex deliberation. My thanks again to all the members of the committee for their time, expertise and full commitment.&gt;I am not declaring a public health emergency of international concern today. As it was yesterday, the Emergency Committee was divided over whether the outbreak of novel coronavirus represents a PHEIC or not. Make no mistake. This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one. WHO’s risk assessment is that the outbreak is a very high risk in China, and a high risk regionally and globally. 584 cases have now been reported to WHO, including 17 deaths. 575 of those cases and all of the deaths have been reported in China, with other cases reported in Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, the United States of America and Vietnam. We are aware of media reports of suspected cases in other countries, but those cases are still being investigated.&gt;Let me talk about what we know. We know that this virus can cause severe disease, and that it can kill, although for most people it causes milder symptoms. We know that among those infected, one quarter of patients have experienced severe disease. We know that most of those who have died had underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease that weakened their immune systems. We know that there is human-to-human transmission in China, but for now it appears limited to family groups and health workers caring for infected patients. At this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. There is still a lot we don’t know. We don’t know the source of this virus, we don’t understand how easily it spreads, and we don’t fully understand its clinical features or severity.&gt;WHO is working with our partners night and day in China and the other affected countries, at the regional level and here at headquarters to fill the gaps in our knowledge as quickly as possible. It is likely that we will see more cases in other parts of China and other countries. China has taken measures it believes appropriate to contain the spread of coronavirus in Wuhan and other cities. We hope that they will be both effective and short in their duration. For the moment, WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade. We recommend exit screening at airports as part of a comprehensive set of containment measures. All countries should have in place measures to detect cases of coronavirus, including at health facilities. The committee has made several recommendations to prevent the further spread of the virus, which the Chair has described, and which I have accepted. There are a few simple things we can all do to protect ourselves and each other, like washing hands, covering your mouth and nose when you sneeze, and so on.&gt;WHO has a full package of information on its website.&gt;Once again, I would like to thank the Government of the People’s Republic of China for its cooperation and transparency. The government has been successful in isolating and sequencing the virus very quickly, and has shared that genetic sequence with WHO and the international community.&gt;This outbreak was detected because China had put in place a system specifically to pick up severe lower respiratory infections. It was that system that caught this event. I wish to reiterate that the fact I am not declaring a PHEIC today should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious, or that we are not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth. WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day, at country, regional and global level. We are working to prevent human-to-human transmission. We have provided guidance to all countries for the rapid identification, management and containment of the virus. We are coordinating our networks of global experts. We are working to advance the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines. We are completely committed to ending this outbreak as soon as possible. And I will not hesitate to reconvene the committee at a moment’s notice - anytime. It could be in a day, it could be in a couple, it could be anytime.&gt;Thank you very much.Source: https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/04/15/835179442/we-alerted-the-world-to-coronavirus-on-jan-5-who-says-in-response-to-u-s?utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=news",,,1587006897,{},fnjtwil,False,t3_g1h9ml,False,True,t1_fnfn37r,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/g1h9ml/how_do_you_feel_about_trump_halting_funding_to/fnjtwil/,1587025487,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,[],1587006897.0,,,

What about a video of Nancy Pelosi walking through San Francisco encouraging residents to go out to eat and gather together?

Do you have any comment on the fact that he was called a “Xenophobe” by these same media bodies for shutting down travel to China before any other nation? Independent of America: Wouldn’t you say China and the WHO are to blame for what’s happening globally right now? Do you think they should escape criticism so you can focus on Trump? Are you aware any criticism you apply to him must be applied to the rest of the western world’s leaders as well? &gt; As per your example if NASA ever screwed up, probably miscalculating the trajectory of an asteroid and found out its headed straight for earth, would defunding the organization during a emergency crisis really be the best course of action?You’ve taken my example too far and it’s no longer comparable, but I’ll play along - my example was really more talking about reputability, not the actual application of the organization. But anyways:If there were a better, more reputable organization to direct those funds to that can solve this problem, wouldn’t you prefer to see that money go there? What is the WHO doing currently to combat this disease? All possible cures and vaccines are being produced by entities that are not them. The WHO is directed to contain outbreaks and ensure the data reported on them is accurate. They’ve already failed at doing this, and we are in the pandemic stage of the disease.

The right however has historically been quick and adamant about criticizing their own radicals. Is Trump is an over correction to this? Trump has often been unwilling to criticize white nationalists and often starts fights over “politically correct” things just because. An example of this is calling it the *chinese* virus. While he is correct in stating that diseases are typically named after the location of origin, it is clear he’s been particularly adamant about this because of the response from the left. Is it beneficial to start such a political fight during a pandemic? Especially over such a meaningless issue? Why not call it the “Wuhan Virus” or Coronavirus as it has been largely been recognized?The second point I am hoping you will further elaborate on is this:&gt; Discrediting the media is goodTrump almost exclusively describes “fake news” as news that is critical to him rather than news that is factually inaccurate.

He was heavily criticized but it was right.    Those 40, 000 people do not include Chinese nationals or other foreigners. They include US citizens, green card holders, permanent residents who had traveled to China. It was the right move because in normal times thousands of Chinese travelers probably land in our major airports every day. NYC especially.      Many were Chinese- Americans who were visiting relatives over there:    I think they made a mistake in only screening people from Wuhan, and Hubei Province. It was likely better to screen anyone who came from China in general because based on what we know now it likely was in other provinces.    Italy was probably one of the most inept. England too.    Italy did not restrict travel. That's not good as they are a huge tourist destination. And they are quite popular with Chinese tourists. Again not saying they should have restricted Chinese tourists for ethnic reasons but because the outbreak was in that country",,,1586114488,{},fmipvfj,False,t3_fu8s7z,False,True,t1_fmhnkgv,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fu8s7z/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_cia_dismissing_the/fmipvfj/,1586114491,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,,1586114488.0,,,

This distinction is SUPER important from an ethics standpoint.&gt; I'm not saying that republicans are causing deathIf so, then there is no ""trade"" happening. It's just them being normal and there happen to be deaths happening. Most of the Democrat governors and most of the Republican governors ARE making a trade. They are choosing to trade putting millions of people into poverty in order to save lives. Some of the Republican governors and 1 Democrat governor we're discussing are NOT making a trade, they are not acting and therefore their lack of actions should not be construed as a trade. They are not causing people to die. And they are also not taking any specific action to sacrifice their economy.I think you're still not fully on the same page with what I'm saying.

I fundamentally disagree with this based on the thought processes and underlying beliefs I laid out above. I believe that the Wuhan Virus is responsible for all deaths and that many governors are willing to act to sacrifice the economy to *save* lives but the reverse cannot be true, since there is no way for the government to actively kill people in order to save the economy.

There's actually one out there surrounding the origin of COVID-19 that falls into this category (I'll elaborate on it later).First, let's define 2 philosophical razors:Occam's razor:  of two competing theories, the simpler explanation of an entity is to be preferred. ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Occams-razor))Newton's Flaming Laser Sword (yes, that is an actual name for Alder's Razor):  what cannot be settled by experiment is not worth debating. (only source I could get is [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Alder))Liberal application of Newton's Flaming Laser Sword is a good thing because it eliminates frivolity.  The Illuminati is a good example of something that can, and should, be dismissed in this way.  Whenever there is a debate over something, let's take Russian Meddling as an example, Occam's Razor should be applied.  If we were to apply Occam's Razor from the outset, it could have eliminated the years long Mueller Investigation entirely since the total Russian investment in our investment was very low, and far from unique.  In fact, the Ukraine investigations yielded evidence that Ukraine may have meddled in some of the ways Russia did in favor of Clinton (i.e. ads and social media). Now, the axioms of the COVID-19 theory:1. COVID-19 originated at a market in Wuhan, China2. China supplied masks and tests to foreign governments, mostly (if not all) faulty3. There are only 2 labs in PRC authorized to work with bioweapons, one of which is next to that market in Wuhan4. There has been some evidence to suggest those labs do not properly dispose of laboratory test animals (i.e. they don't cremate them)5. After PRC expels all foreign journalists, new cases and fatalities miraculously drop to near 0Conclusion: COVID-19 is a Chinese bioweapon.My thoughts on the theory: I'd like to think it's not true, but it's sufficiently simple that it can't be immediately eliminated by Occam's Razor, and it's sufficiently testable to stand up to Newton's Flaming Laser Sword.  I think it might b worth investigating.  If nothing else, it's worth investigating the second and fifth axioms.With regard to trust in government: I generally distrust *all* government, and there's very little that I want to be handled by the public sector as opposed to the private or volunteer sectors.

I'm certainly not trying to claim other first world countries did a good job. Currently I'm only giving passing marks to Singapore, Taiwan, HK, and SK. The West has really disappointed. I see three key areas of failure in our response so far, where European nations certainly did a better job than we did.1. Early testing. If this had been handled competently, and swiftly we could have used a containment strategy similar to SK, rather than needing to resort to mitigation. This would have saved countless lives, and many, many trillions of dollars in economic damage. Testing is better, but not where it should be. 5 day turnaround from labs is typical (so the numbers we're seeing are actually nearly a week old). We only reached the point where we could test a semi-reasonable number of people perhaps two weeks ago. It is difficult to overstate the impact of this failure. 2. Failure to take the illness seriously early on, resulting in a failure to ensure that hospitals had adequate resources. We should have been rapidly expanding PPE production in early-mid February. It was blindingly obvious to the medical community that this was going to be a disaster at that point. In my area, the lack of PPE for healthcare workers has reached the point where it is impossible for us to care for patients without assuming substantial risk of exposure. Hospital systems are by and large using threats of professional retaliation to try to tamp down complaints and prevent information on how dire the situation is from emerging, but their efforts have not been entirely successful. Most doctors and nurses are lucky to be granted one disposable N95 for the entire day. These respirators are not designed to be reusable, nor are they designed to be used for long periods of time. Many are going their entire shifts without eating or drinking, because they do not want to risk compromising their masks by taking them off. Covering them with bandanas to try to keep them clean is commonplace. It feels like working in a third world country. Thousands of healthcare workers will die because of this, and tens (if not hundreds) of thousands will be sickened. This will reduce the number of people who are able to help the sick, making the impact of the virus that much worse.3. Failure to take this virus seriously early on, resulting in a failure to make sensible recommendations to the public at large. Implementing even basic social distancing measures back in February would have made a difference. Instead, the Federal Government consistently downplayed the virus. If you look at polling from late Feb., it is clear that Republicans were grossly misinformed about the magnitude of the threat this virus posed to society at large, in large part because they were getting their information from political figures such as Trump. The incongruous messaging seen between the Government and actual public health experts led to confusion, and delayed the ability of the country to respond appropriately. One of the most frustrating things of all was the incongruity between the swift implementation of the initial travel ban on China, and the actions the government took immediately thereafter. That was certainly the right move, and bought us enough time that we probably could have contained the virus if we did everything right. Unfortunately, we did everything wrong for the next month and a half.You can find more detailed breakdowns of what went wrong on the NYT, or on site like Medscape that are targeted at doctors and other medical professionals. Frankly, where our preparedness ranked compared to others is not as meaningful as looking retrospectively at what went wrong and how we could do better. I am hopeful that we will be better prepared next time. Given China is already reopening wet markets, I'm pretty sure there will be a next time, unfortunately. We got lucky this time around. This virus spreads very easily, but it isn't nearly as deadly as something like Avian flu. Next time may not go the same way. I think it's critical that we learn from what went wrong here. If this were Avian flu, and we responded the same way to it that we did to COVID, a very large percentage of Americans would die. It's also critical that we do everything we can now to make up for our failures early on. I'm not sure why Trump is still being shy about compelling the production of PPE? He absolutely did the right thing by strong arming GM. Our lack of PPE is at least as bad as our lack of ventilators right now, and it will be a long lasting problem as the virus spreads throughout the country. Some areas are probably still months away from seeing their peak. It may be too late to protect healthcare workers in the NY metro area, but we may be able to protect those in other parts of the country that won't be as hard hit for weeks or months to come. Looking at pictures of how doctors and nurses in Wuhan were protecting themselves vs those in NYC is downright shameful. We can and must do better. Sorry for the rant. I have quite a few sick friends/coworkers and a couple sick family members, and I'm very angry about how this was handled by the government early on, and is being handled by many hospital systems right now.",,,1585692529,{},fm28gwy,False,t3_frsfbs,False,True,t1_fm24wdx,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/frsfbs/according_to_the_wh_100_000_200_000_deaths_is_the/fm28gwy/,1585696011,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,,1585692529.0,,,

The Wuhan Public Security Bureau charged Dr. Li Wenliang and seven others who tried to warn the rest of the world about the Virus. Li mysteriously died a few days later and the seven disappeared without a trace.5. **January 1st**: Hubei Provincial Health Commission ordered genomics companies to stop testing people in Wuhan and destroy the existing samples. This is why their cases seem so low compared to the US, despite being the epic-center of the virus.6. **January 2nd**: The Wuhan Institute of Virology made a breakthough in mapping the virus to help combat it, but did not give it out for another week.7. **January 3rd**: China’s National Health Commission ordered no more information be released to the press about the disease and samples to be destroyed.8. **January 6th:** The US government is finally notified about the virus, but by this time it was already in the US. It took 1 month from the start of the outbreak to now for the US government to hear about this. Trump later banned all travel to and from China before their was even a death in the United states.

The issue is more that, colloquially, almost everyone in the United States calls it the Coronavirus; and the scientific is SARS-CoV-2 (for the virus) and COVID-19 (for the disease). So, **insisting** that it’s called something else is clearly purposeful.If, hypothetically, the G7 statement referred to it as the “Wuhan Virus,” I think an argument could be made that the statement should be changed to say something else: “Coronavirus,” because that’s how most people know it; or “SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19,” because those are its scientific names. But, I don’t see the *purpose* in insisting it be called “Wuhan Virus” in official documents.I understand that there is precedence in naming a virus after a location with which it’s associated. But, if it already had multiple names in common usage, what’s the point in **intentionally** renaming it?The only reason I can think of, is that there’s some administration policy to reinforce the link between COVID-19 and China. I can only speculate regarding the reason for this policy, but I assume: (1) it’s part of the administration’s ongoing efforts to “beat” China; (2) the policy has its origins in xenophobia; and/or (3) the policy was intentionally put in place to “trigger the libs.”So, my questions are:1. What is the point in ***intentionally re-***naming the virus?2. Assuming the reason is related to one of the reasons I speculated above, are any of those reasons good enough to refuse to take part in a G7 statement?3.

My question is why? &gt; Depends. Is the person in question attributing a racist motive because they don't like him? Or are they going to assume he's simply going with the name most of the news media used when the story first broke? LinkThis rhetorical person would be in the group of Americans described by you and the OP as being ""most of Americans"" who aren't paying close attention to the news. The rationale for the use of Chinese virus over the more commonly accepted names (I had never heard it called anything novel corona virus or maybe Wuhan before Trump started calling it Chinese. Doesn't mean others weren't also, I just didn't hear or read that use) is that it's geopolitics to hammer China for blaming the US and how their government has been dishonest with the world and terrible to their own citizens. Now if that argument holds water, who is picking up on that subtext? If people generally aren't, outside of his hardcore supporters and maybe punditry, and there appear to be negative consequences towards people of Chinese or Asian descent, what benefit to continue to use that name? Put another way, what would it cost him to call it Covid or Coronavirus?",,,1585223487,{},fljqo9m,False,t3_fov31t,False,True,t1_flj3p0q,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fov31t/what_are_your_thoughts_on_trumps_latest_approval/fljqo9m/,1585223488,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,,1585223487.0,,,

Are you saying that because there was a window of time that the virus existed, and its corresponding disease didn't have a name, that means it's useful today to refer to it as a new name that people weren't using before it had its scientific name?Huh? Covid-19 and Sars-cov-2 were names given to the disease and virus respectively on the 11th feb. Before the 11th feb there were no scientific names. I can understand why people would call it chinese or wuhan (corona)virus because it makes it easy to know what you're talking about and which coronavirus it is. As I said in my other comment, I think people should use the scientific name after the 11th feb but i can understand why they may choose to use the chinese virus term or whatever as well.&gt; I can find no reporting that uses the name ""Chinese virus"" before it was called ""novel coronavirus"" and ""COVID-19"" in medical and mainstream press. because you can't find it in the press it doesn't mean people weren't using it.&gt; I *don't* understand why someone would use the term ""for clarity"".

By analogy, viruses closely related to SARS-Cov-2 may be circulating in one or more animal species. Initial analyses indicate that Malayan pangolins ( Manis javanica ) illegally imported into Guangdong province contain a CoV that is similar to SARS-CoV-218,19. Although the bat virus RaTG13 remains the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 across the whole genome, the Malayan pangolin CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at all six key RBD residues (Figure 1). However, no pangolin CoV has yet been identified that is sufficiently similar to SARS-CoV-2 across its entire genome to support direct human infection. In addition, the pangolin CoV does not carry a polybasic cleavage site insertion. For a precursor virus to acquire the polybasic cleavage site and mutations in the spike protein suitable for human ACE2 receptor binding, an animal host would likely have to have a high population density – to allow natural selection to proceed efficiently – and an ACE2 gene that is similar to the human orthologue. Further characterization of CoVs in pangolins and other animals that may harbour SARS-CoV-like viruses should be a public health priority....&gt;ConclusionsIn the midst of the global COVID-19 public health emergency it is reasonable to wonder why the origins of the epidemic matter. A detailed understanding of how an animal virus jumped species boundaries to infect humans so productively will help in the prevention of future zoonotic events. For example, if SARS-CoV-2 pre-adapted in another animal species then we are at risk of future re-emergence events even if the current epidemic is controlled. In contrast, if the adaptive process we describe occurred in humans, then even if we have repeated zoonotic transfers they are unlikely to take-off unless the same series of mutations occurs. In addition, identifying the closest animal relatives of SARS-CoV-2 will greatly assist studies of virus function. Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence facilitated the comparative genomic analysis performed here, helping to reveal the key mutations in the RBD as well as the polybasic cleavage site insertion.&gt;The genomic features described here may in part explain the infectiousness and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Although genomic evidence does not support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory construct, it is currently impossible to prove or disprove the other theories of its origin described here, and it is unclear whether future data will help resolve this issue. Identifying the immediate non-human animal source and obtaining virus sequences from it would be the most definitive way of revealing virus origins. In addition, it would be helpful to obtain more genetic and functional data about the virus, including experimental studies of receptor binding and the role of the polybasic cleavage site and predicted O-linked glycans. The identification of a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the sequencing of very early cases including those not connected to the Wuhan market, would similarly be highly informative. Irrespective of how SARS-CoV-2 originated, the ongoing surveillance of pneumonia in humans and other animals is clearly of utmost importance.Very good info. Good to know I was right about the markets, bats, and pangolins being a problem.",,,1584990699,{},flatb85,False,t3_fnis73,False,True,t1_flabowx,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fnis73/is_the_country_taking_social_distancing_seriously/flatb85/,1584992887,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,,1584990699.0,,,

I have an extremely nuanced view of them.I live near a town with a high proportion of Chinese students. I have dated two - my ex, and my current GF of 3.5 years.I have been to China. I speak a non-trivial amount of Chinese (我说一千字). I know personally several CCP members (my GF's parents are both officers in the PLA - her dad is a colonel). Her uncle is a fairly important person at Chinese NASA.My ex-gf is from Wuhan (though currently she lives in Beijing). Her dad is a doctor there. I've asked her for on the ground information about Wuhan.Through these connections I've also made various Chinese friends who live in multiple cities throughout China whom I converse with semi-regularly. I am aware of nuanced perspectives that many Chinese people have on their government and how it works. My GF for example is not a huge fan of Xi and thinks he is in some ways taking her country backwards.Given my connection to China, which is a bit stronger than the average US citizen, what are my thoughts on this situation, and China generally?I think that the officials in Hubei province hid the infection at first - and that this was due to a systemic fault in the Chinese political system, that emphasizes not losing face if at all possible. That caused them to hide the infection until it had started spreading.I think that the national government actually had a pretty pro-active response when it was made aware of the infection. They shut down Wuhan and Hubei province at around 600-800 infected people. New York City and Seattle, with far more advanced warning, and a greater knowledge of how the virus progressed and how deadly it was, did not shut down their cities until much higher numbers of infected.I think that Chinese wet markets with exotic animals were at fault for starting this disease, and I applaud the Chinese government for shutting it down. All of the Chinese people I know are against this practice, and as far as I can tell it seems to be a minority of citizens - almost all upper middle class individuals ""fronting"" - trying to show off how cool they are to social media - that are eating these animals.I think that the human rights situation in Xinjiang is deplorable and that the Chinese government is acting horribly there. I think the organ harvesting is straight evil.I think Xi is both good and bad for China. I think that his leadership will likely lead to greater economic growth. I also think that his leadership will lead to greater oppression and suppression of dissidents and I certainly don't support that. The Chinese people, most of whom have been poor until relatively recently, and who have seen 10x private GDP growth over the past 20 years, seem to see it as an acceptable, but not necessarily desirable trade-off. A lot of younger people don't like Xi that much.As for having been in China? It's substantially less repressive than you see in the media. I could go anywhere I pleased, drink anywhere (even the Great Wall, though they make you buy the beer on the wall), buy anything anywhere - if anything, it felt like much of Chinese society was ruleless - not draconian. Yeah, political protests or posting things against the government on social media to huge number of followers is typically treated pretty harshly - **which I want to be clear, I STRONGLY do not support** - but for the average person on the street, life is pretty normal.And as for the Chinese whistleblower? I don't think he was killed. The national government's response on this has been, as I've mentioned, to take it pretty damn seriously. It was entirely the Hubei government that tried to persecute and bother him, and their entire leadership got fired due to this.So rather than claiming that ""liberals"" defend the CCP, maybe ask who you're talking to first - I'm not defending them, I'm giving off my nuanced perspective as someone who is, well, maybe not an expert on China, but certainly an expert as far as Americans on Reddit are concerned.",,,1584726504,{},fl1cw0v,False,t3_flvcy7,False,True,t1_fl197sp,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/flvcy7/what_do_you_think_of_trump_crossing_out_corona_in/fl1cw0v/,1584728007,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,,1584726504.0,,,

""Spanish flu"" may have actually originated in America but unfortunately this was during the war and the US made the ill informed decision to suppress news of the outbreak to keep morale high.

A week later, a group of researchers led by German scientists released the first diagnostic protocol for COVID-19 using swabbed samples from a patient’s nose and throat; this PCR-based protocol has since been selected by the World Health Organization (WHO).As stated, the genome sequence for the SARS-COV-2 virus was released on January 10th. At this time, groups across the world started developing a diagnostic test using the sequence. A week later, Friday, January 17th, a group out of Germany released a diagnostic protocol, as mentioned above. It's not clear exactly when exactly the WHO ""selected"" this protocol, but they [released guidance on the same day](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330676/9789240000971-eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y) with no mention of any one specific protocol.

Here is a specific statement on the topic:Nancy Messonnier, Director of National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases&gt; In terms of our response: Over the weekend CDC finalized development of a real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction – abbreviated as rRT-PCR – test that can diagnose this new virus. We used this test to quickly confirm our first U.S. case. So the CDC had a test up and running over the same weekend as the selected WHO protocol was released. [The CDC made their protocol  public on January 24th.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html)[Currently, the WHO site for current guidance lists many different testing protocols, including the one used by US and dozens of other countries.](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance).Even further, here is information about the actual flaw in the CDC test:[This link explains the flaw fairly accurately](https://cen.acs.org/analytical-chemistry/diagnostics/Faulty-probes-blame-CDC-coronavirus/98/i9)&gt; The problems were first reported by the Washington Post, and C&amp;EN learned soon after that the kits contained faulty reagents that led to inconclusive readouts.&gt; Kelly Wroblewski, a microbiologist who leads infectious disease programs at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, says the reagents that didn’t work properly are nucleic acid probes designed to detect RNA sequences of **all coronaviruses that infect humans, including milder strains that are endemic to the US population.** These probes serve as a beacon, she says, that a coronavirus is present and that the sample should be tested further to determine whether that coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2 or another. It’s not clear at what step the probes failed or if they failed, for example, because of reaction conditions. Wroblewski also told Science that there were problems with signals appearing in a negative control experiment in the kit.&gt;The kit contains two other sets of probes that are specific to SARS-CoV-2 and are used to determine whether a patient is infected with the novel coronavirus. **CDC officials have said that with a revised protocol, the older kits can be used with just those two sets of probes. New kits, which presumably contain a working third set of probes, are being made. CDC officials did not respond to requests to clarify the problems with the older kits.**&gt; “It’s not necessary. It’s a nice to have, not a need to have,” Wroblewski says of the ability of the kits to detect other coronaviruses. “It doesn’t really impact the actual sensitivity of the assay when you are looking for novel coronavirus.”So the flaw was with a part of the test that doesn't even specifically look for the novel coronavirus, and those same kits can still be used.

In other words, if hospitals are overwhelmed and cannot effectively treat other diseases due to COVID-19 patients using up so many resources, do we include avoidable deaths due to other causes in the overall total? How would we even calculate that?Edit: an addendum. The CDC's Burden of Flu [website](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html) states that the 0.1% mortality rate of flu is based off of symptomatic individuals and does not include those who carry flu without showing symptoms (or having only mild symptoms that they dismiss as a common cold). By this logic, if we compare mortality rates for these two diseases as a proportion of those who show symptoms (which is the best data we have right now) then SARS-CoV2 is still an order of magnitude more lethal at a minimum.

Although that estimate applies specifically  to Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, and is based on  data from there, it offers a guide to the rest of the world, where many  countries might see even lower death rates.  &gt;  &gt;The new figure is **significantly below earlier estimates of 2% or 3%** and well below the death rate for China based on simply dividing deaths by cases,  which yields almost 4%. While it is still higher than the average 0.1%  death rate from seasonal flu, it raises hopes that the worst consequence  of the coronavirus will be uncommon...  &gt;  &gt;...As physicians and researchers have seen since the start of the  outbreak, many infected people never become sick. **As few as 14% of  people in Wuhan with early coronavirus infections were being detected**,  said epidemiologist Jeffrey Shaman of the Mailman School of Public  Health at Columbia University, who led a study published on Monday in Science on undocumented coronavirus infections.  &gt;  &gt;“I think there are many more than the \[nearly\] 70,000” confirmed Covid-19 cases in Hubei province, Shaman told reporters.  &gt;  &gt;That means the “infection fatality rate” — deaths among people who  have the virus but might or might not show disease symptoms — is **even lower than Wu and his colleagues calculate.**[""'Stealth Transmission' Fuels Fast Spread of Coronavirus Outbreak"" \[the Columbia University findings\]](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/public-health-now/news/stealth-transmission-fuels-fast-spread-coronavirus-outbreak)&gt;The researchers report:  &gt;  &gt;• **86 percent of all infections were undocumented** prior to the January 23 Wuhan travel shutdown•  Per person, these undocumented infections were half (52 percent) as  contagious as documented infections yet were the source of two-thirds of  documented infections• Government control efforts and population  awareness have reduced the rate of spread of the virus in China; after  travel restrictions and control measures were imposed, it spread less  quickly  &gt;  &gt;**“The explosion of COVID-19 cases in China was largely  driven by individuals with mild, limited, or no symptoms who went  undetected,**” says co-author [Jeffrey Shaman](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/jls106),  PhD, professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University  Mailman School. “Depending on their contagiousness and numbers,  undetected cases can expose a far greater portion of the population to  virus than would otherwise occur. We find for COVID-19 in China these  undetected infected individuals are numerous and contagious. These  stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to the  containment of this outbreak going forward.”My takeaway from this research is that the current 1.4% mortality rate is based on the confirmed cases of COVID-19—which researchers now believe represents only 14% of those who have actually been infected. Many of those undiagnosed cases displayed no symptoms at all. If 86% of COVID-19 cases have gone undiagnosed, then this drops the **real** mortality rate to 0.2% which is only slightly more than the seasonal flu's 0.1% mortality rate.As for those who dying in the US, CNN gives a breakdown of the 112 deaths so far: [""Here's what we know about the 100 people who've died in the US from coronavirus""](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-united-states-deaths/index.html)&gt;Most of them were 60 years and older  &gt;  &gt;Health officials have said that [older adults were twice as likely](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/health/coronavirus-older-people-social-distancing/index.html) to have serious illness from the novel coronavirus and the fatal cases in the US appear to reflect that.The majority of people who have died were in their 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. **The youngest were in their early or mid-50s.**  &gt;  &gt;**Many lived in nursing homes or other facilities**  &gt;  &gt;The  deadliest cluster so far has been linked to a nursing home in Kirkland,  Washington. More than 20 people who lived there and someone who visited  the facility have died.People who lived in other long-term care facilities in Washington, Florida and Kansas contracted the virus and died.  &gt;  &gt;**Many had other health problems**  &gt;  &gt;Diabetes,  emphysema and heart problems were among the pre-existing conditions  that some people suffered before they were diagnosed with coronavirus.My takeaway is that we've got a flu bug that spreads more rapidly than the seasonal flu, but largely due to the fact that unlike the seasonal flu the Wuhan Flu *often displays mild symptoms or no symptoms at all*. In other words, in many ways this flu is milder than the ones that we are used to which means that it gets spread more easily by otherwise healthy individuals until it encounters an elderly person with an underlying condition.

You can't just declare a national emergency out of 5 cases. So the number of cases had to hit high enough before there is a justification to call it a pandemic and declare a national emergency.   &gt; I think you might be misunderstanding that source. We have the capacity to run tests to diagnose 175k people per week. They're not actually doing that many tests.  No, I'm definitely not misunderstanding it. That's the capacity, we can currently do up to 175K tests per week (or 25K per day). That's increasing also, as the we're adding more testing.  &gt; Taken together, that’s still a tiny fraction of the number that should be conducted in a country of 327 million people, say experts. As of March 11, CDC, state and public health labs have conducted more than 11,000 tests since mid-January. By comparison, South Korea has tested more than 200,000 of its population of 51 million since January.  They have the capacity to do 15K tests per day, we have the capacity to do 25K tests per day. The distance between Wuhan and Seoul is just 868 miles, and the outbreak spread there much faster.  The distance between Wuhan and San Francisco 6457 miles and we just got our first serious increase in cases, which warrants the national emergency declaration. South Korea's exposure to China is much bigger. Not sure how you expect us to have more tests done in the US since we haven't had anywhere near as many cases, nor have we had exposure for as long as they've had.

The White House had to later clarify that copayments would be waived for testing and coverage extended to treatments.  Waiving and extending are verrry different.   Waiving means no charge, extending means that your insurance will act normally as if you had any ailment. I’m glad he got the waiving of testing costs, awesome.

If you want to make 3 or 4 separate replies, I'm cool with that.&gt;In terms of Trump's response to the Wuhan flu crisis, I'd  like to see him go beyond what is necessary, but only in close  consultation with the CDC, as well as the local authorities in areas  that might be affected by his statements. I doubt it would do any good  for Trump to unilaterally say ""State X might get hit by a hurricane!""  without at least warning the authorities in State X that he was going to  say it - otherwise it might prompt a mass panic.I think you've actually outlined how most Americans view Trump's tweet. It was relatively in line with the potential situations forecasted by several national agencies. Even the BirminghamNWS was clearly *aware* that hurricane was approaching the region and it's quite a stretch to think that Alabama residents—who had been watching the storm develop for days and had been hearing alternating reports of its predicted path—would be reduced to a panic over a tweet saying ""be careful.""I do hope that, provided the corona virus is properly addressed and does not become a national health emergency, Trump receives appropriate credit from his credits—otherwise we're pretty much damned to our current outrage cycle. By the same token, I hope that if the virus proves to be exceptionally difficult, that Trump errs on the side of declaring a national emergency rather than downplaying it. I'd rather see an abundance of resources directed towards a potential epidemic as opposed to hesitancy.&gt;I  will say that I believe a lot of Trump's geographical errors are made  worse by his inability to accept blame or acknowledge a mistake. If he just laughed off the hurricane situation, for example, and apologized,  it's likely that the whole thing would've gone away.I don't think you'll get much opposition here from ANY supporters. I think as much as NS's wish that Trump could laugh at himself that TS's wish the press and opposition party would *let* him laugh at himself rather than turning regular human behavior into a cause for attack.I'll even say, yeah Trump started it. (I still have not been disabused of my original theory that Trump came out swinging against the media because he intended to launch a news network once he inevitably lost in the primaries and he was cultivating a loyal audience) But at present, I'd say it's a stalemate and probably one none of us enjoy. Obama dropping the ""Thanks Obama"" line in his video was great. Trump joking that he hates energy-saving light bulbs because ""they make me look orange"" should have likewise received a bipartisan laugh rather than being used as fodder for polemical puff pieces.Now as for your questions:&gt;Do  you think Trump lacks knowledge of these places, or just forgets?100% personal opinion based on my general observations: I'd say Trump is one of those ""successful"" (define that how you wish) people who has savant-level knowledge of those things which directly matter to them and accomplishing their goals and a virtual blindness to things beyond those. You want to talk New York business, the entertainment industry, reality television and marketing yourself to the masses, etc? I'm sure he could talk for days. You want to talk geography? Probably not a lot going on there. Now, if we want to talk about what a president *should* be an expert in, that's its own massive conversation—and one we'd probably find a lot of agreement on. Hillary was hands down the better policy wonk. Among the current DNC field, it's absolutely Elizabeth Warren. But you also have to get people to like you.....(And no, it's not an issue of latent sexism. Almost every candidate appears pretty unlikeable to most Americans. Is Trump ""likeable""? Not really, but he got *enough* people to like him.)&gt;And  as a historian, what did you think of Trumps claim that we were  justified in abandoning the SDF because Kurdish forces didn’t fight with  us at Normandy? Does that display a proper ability to perceive analogies or draw historical parallels, that is necessary for a leader with POTUS’ status to have?Personally, I don't touch Middle Eastern history. You can absolutely use the past to justify present actions—you pull from libraries of books—but there's always going to be an opposing library of books arguing the opposite. And they're both going to be true and grounded in defensible evidence.If we're looking at Trump's comment as an actual, scholarly defense of a military decision on the basis of Kurdish history, then it's not going to hold much water. It would be like a Japanese company deciding not to merge with a US company ""because of what happened at Hiroshima."" It might add some rhetorical oomph to the decision, but not really a historical argument.What it really comes down to is how TS's and NS's view language and communication. If I can use the broad brush here, I'd say that liberals attribute *far* more power to words and language than conservatives and thus are much more policing of language and vigilant for signals of oppression. And I think this stems from the general liberal and conservative conceptions of human nature. For conservatives, humans have intrinsic dark sides of greed and sin and therefore a harmonious society depends on counterbalancing these negative traits and an *abundance* of casual, genuine, unfiltered speech through conversation is the best way to determine the extent to which someone else has overcome their negative traits and become trustworthy. Imprecise language is much less problematic for conservatives because they begin with an assumption of a flawed human. Conversely, for liberals there is a general assumption of human goodness. Therefore an abundance of unguarded, imprecise speech will often result in revealing the extent to which an individual has become corrupted and lost their standing in society as an innocent and tolerant being.I think this point gets at why TS's can acknowledge Trump's often poor use of language while still supporting him: Everyone is flawed and politicians who only give carefully constructed are not convincing anyone of their goodness—they are only hiding their inherent flaws. Thus making them actually *less trustworthy* than the candidates who speak crudely and off-the-cuff.",,,1580852359,{},fgjvspg,False,t3_eyc070,False,True,t1_fgj828i,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/eyc070/what_do_you_think_of_president_trumps_notable/fgjvspg/,1580853363,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,,0,,1580852359.0,,,
